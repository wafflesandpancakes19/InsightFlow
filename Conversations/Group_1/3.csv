SPEAKER_01," Yeah, my boss sent me over, so I figured I'd come.",25.965,28.477
SPEAKER_01, Your boss sent you over?,29.0,30.0
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,30.102,30.592
SPEAKER_00, What reason do you think your boss had for doing that?,32.027,34.0
SPEAKER_01, There was this issue with a couple of the people I wanted to team with.,35.148,36.98
SPEAKER_01," They couldn't relate to my ideas, and my boss saw it as being kind of, you know, not working super well,  so she wanted me to come over and talk about it.",37.16,46.0
SPEAKER_00, She wanted you to come over and talk about your relationship with your coworkers?,48.027,52.0
SPEAKER_01," I think more just so that, you know, my ideas were just kind of higher than what they could really understand,  so maybe learn how to talk to other people so that they can understand me.",52.0,61.975
SPEAKER_01," Okay, and what do you mean by higher?",63.1,64.466
SPEAKER_00,"Like, your ideas were higher?",65.691,66.855
SPEAKER_00," You know, just a little bit more intelligent.",68.323,69.576
SPEAKER_01," You know, I'm just at a level that other people can't always reach to.",70.362,73.095
SPEAKER_01," You know, just a little bit higher, sometimes a lot higher, but just on this team,  they just couldn't understand, you know, my language or what I was saying, and I couldn't see the vision that I had.",74.0,82.675
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so they were unable to reach your level of expression for this, it was like a project you were working on?",84.02,91.176
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, yeah.",93.592,93.898
SPEAKER_00, Was it?,94.102,94.306
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,94.327,94.429
SPEAKER_00, And your boss recognized this difference and thought that the counseling may be helpful?,95.02,98.91
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,103.878,103.98
SPEAKER_01," Do you think, you know, counseling will be helpful?",105.0,106.859
SPEAKER_01," I think it's good, you know, so that my boss is happy that I went, but I think it could also be useful in the sense of, you know,  other people are just jealous of me a lot and they just can't really relate to me, so it might be, you know,  great to learn how to really, you know, like, kind of understand what they're going through at their level.",108.042,125.659
SPEAKER_01," Again, you say at their level, so are you meaning, again, that they're kind of below you with your skills and-",126.02,130.571
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, they're just, they haven't accomplished as much, you know, they don't know as many people,",134.0,138.859
SPEAKER_01," they're not hanging out with those prestigious ranks, you know, they haven't been educated to the quality that I have been,  so they just, sometimes it's hard for them to understand where I'm coming from or, you know, what I can see happening.",139.0,147.873
SPEAKER_01," Okay, so counseling can help you bridge that gap?",150.221,151.872
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so counseling can help you bridge that gap to communicate more effectively?",153.201,158.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, so I can, you know, so I can be even better.",158.1,160.43
SPEAKER_01,"You know, I'm here, but I want to be like here.",161.454,163.0
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so when you say you're here at the first level-  Not first, but like, still more.",163.0,167.732
SPEAKER_01, Still more.,169.204,169.551
SPEAKER_00, Still more.,170.122,170.531
SPEAKER_00," So like, where you are, tell me where you are currently in terms of how you perceive yourself, like how you look at yourself.",171.221,177.0
SPEAKER_01," Maybe like a seven, but I want to like blow it out of the park.",177.782,180.43
SPEAKER_01,"You know, like if ten is here, I want to be higher than that.",180.851,183.398
SPEAKER_00, How would you plan on accomplishing that?,184.302,186.638
SPEAKER_01," Well, you know, I'm always getting recruited for these really prestigious classes and to speak places and people are always calling.",187.582,193.98
SPEAKER_01," I have a really large social media presence, so people are constantly asking me for advice, you know, just about everything.",194.12,199.0
SPEAKER_01," Because, you know, I've just accomplished so much that I'm just, I can really help people because I just, you know,  I've just been really lucky to just be good at so many things.",199.763,207.819
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so it sounds like you have a lot of strengths.",208.886,210.98
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah.",211.909,212.677
SPEAKER_00, And that maybe from your understanding that people are just getting jealous because you seem to succeed in so many things.,214.203,221.78
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, you know, like sometimes people just, it's hard to admit that you're just not as good, or like you can't do it.",222.1,227.0
SPEAKER_01, Maybe people don't want to admit that and I think I make them uncomfortable because I can.,227.141,230.775
SPEAKER_00," So counseling will help you to relate to them in a way that, so how would they, in a more productive way, how would they describe you, you know, given this level of difference that you're talking about,  how would they describe you if I were to ask them, if I could ask them, could you describe Sam what they say?",232.681,250.88
SPEAKER_01," I think they would say that I have a lot of people that look up to me, that I'm excellent at my job, that, you know, like I should really be vice president, if not president, but I mean I don't own the company, but I should really have a more significant position.",251.481,265.0
SPEAKER_01," That a lot of the presentations that are happening that I could probably do, but they don't want to, you know, other people need opportunities, but it would be clear for everyone if I just did them.",266.483,275.88
SPEAKER_00, It would be easier?,277.596,278.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, you know, easier, better, more people, it would just be, it would be a great presentation if I did it, so it would just cut away all the other stuff.",278.14,285.759
SPEAKER_00," All the other stuff, that's what your co-workers would include?",287.148,288.919
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, yeah.",289.224,290.0
SPEAKER_00, Things that maybe detract from the...,291.329,292.779
SPEAKER_01," Right, like if, you know, if I was doing the sales pitches, we would blow it out of the park.",294.122,297.468
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, we'd be multi-millionaires by now.",297.588,299.231
SPEAKER_01,"So, you know, it would get rid of all that, you know, the grunt work type of stuff if I just did it myself.",299.812,304.0
SPEAKER_00, Does it frustrate you that you're not called on for every task?,305.461,309.272
SPEAKER_00,Are you not recognized?,310.736,311.659
SPEAKER_01," Sometimes, but I've gotten really good at reminding people that they should be calling on me for every task, because, you know, sometimes you just have to show them, you know, I'm better than that person or I could do it better, and I'm really good at that type of communication, so I've been able to secure a lot of positions that weren't given to me at first because they realize, like, oh, she's better at it.",312.18,332.399
SPEAKER_00, So they can see your talent.,333.321,334.505
SPEAKER_00,So they recognize you much of the time?,335.769,338.458
SPEAKER_00," I mean, most of the time.",339.122,339.918
SPEAKER_00, Most of the time.,340.0,340.571
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, definitely.",341.04,341.525
SPEAKER_00, How long have you been with this particular employer?,344.266,346.799
SPEAKER_01, Maybe like six months.,347.949,349.0
SPEAKER_01, Six months.,349.551,349.98
SPEAKER_01, Maybe eight.,350.245,350.98
SPEAKER_00," Eight months, okay.",351.1,352.765
SPEAKER_00,"Can you tell me about the job you had prior, like what happened there?",353.246,357.819
SPEAKER_01, I outgrew them.,359.24,359.902
SPEAKER_01,"So I got it to a really, you know, large leadership position, and then, you know, the other VP couldn't really see what I was going for.",361.304,370.76
SPEAKER_01," She couldn't relate to me, and she, you know, she wasn't from the same type of like collegiate background, so that was kind of an issue.",371.802,378.86
SPEAKER_01," So I just outgrew what they had to offer, and then this company came in and made this tremendous offer with, you know, it was just fantastic.",379.341,386.9
SPEAKER_01," So I just had to make a move that was more strategic for me, and, you know, that I could even reach more.",387.682,393.639

SPEAKER_01,"You know, like even with like my social media platforms or whatever, people really rely on what I have to say, you know.",425.023,430.96

SPEAKER_00, All right.,437.982,438.904

SPEAKER_01,I was the one that initiated that.,462.998,463.98

SPEAKER_00, All right.,469.482,469.783

SPEAKER_01," But it was really, it was another situation that just didn't, we just weren't communicating well.",485.602,490.378
SPEAKER_01," But in the end, I had to do what was best for me.",492.043,494.068
SPEAKER_01,"So, because afterwards they were calling me and trying to get me back, but I was already here, so I wasn't going to go back there.",494.669,499.0

SPEAKER_01," Yeah, and I, you know, I want to make my boss happy, but I feel like it would be good, you know, I don't want to make people feel bad because they're inferior to me and because they're not as successful, so if I could learn how to, you know, talk with them so that I'm not, you know, so they don't feel bad about themselves.",541.881,554.9
