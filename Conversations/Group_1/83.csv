," Hi, I'm Judy.",7.724,8.407
, How are you doing?,11.523,12.508
, I'm pretty good.,15.143,15.98
SPEAKER_00," Well welcome, sit down.",16.121,17.899
SPEAKER_00, Have you ever been to a counseling session before?,19.027,20.859
SPEAKER_00," No, this will be my first time.",22.067,23.497
SPEAKER_00," Well okay then, so just a little bit about us.",24.02,26.617
SPEAKER_00, We're a counseling center and we work with people with a range of different things going on with them.,27.261,31.94
SPEAKER_00, And between the two of us we can work through whatever is going on with you in your life.,32.944,36.639
SPEAKER_00," But before we begin, I just wanted to let you know that everything you say here is confidential.",37.783,42.318
SPEAKER_00, Unless you're intending to harm yourself or other people and then we're obligated to report it for their own safety.,43.0,48.86
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,49.182,49.828
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that makes sense too.",51.0,51.612
SPEAKER_00, Great.,52.06,53.746
SPEAKER_00,"So I also just want to forewarn you, today is going to be a lot of questions.",53.766,57.518
SPEAKER_00, Just trying to get some background of where you're at and where you want to go.,58.08,61.916
SPEAKER_00," Also, would it be okay with you if I write down some things as we talk?",63.904,67.177
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's totally fine.",68.0,69.818
SPEAKER_00, Great.,70.02,71.085
SPEAKER_00,"So to begin, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?",71.106,73.276
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, like I said, my name is Judy.",74.0,75.928
SPEAKER_01,I'm 42.,75.948,76.49
SPEAKER_01,I have two kids.,76.631,77.032
SPEAKER_01," Max, who's eight years old, and Chelsea, who is six.",79.501,82.249
SPEAKER_01,Max plays soccer.,82.35,83.312
SPEAKER_01,He's very active around the home.,83.372,85.117
SPEAKER_01, Like almost too active.,86.381,87.926
SPEAKER_01,"And Chelsea is a little know-all, but keeps me in line.",88.367,92.178
SPEAKER_01," And kids are both very active, pretty good in school, get along pretty well, and they're good.",93.0,100.799
SPEAKER_01, They're good kids.,101.163,101.776
SPEAKER_01,Sweet kids.,101.796,102.0
SPEAKER_00, Good.,102.525,102.768
SPEAKER_00,I'm so glad.,102.808,103.576
SPEAKER_00, So I'd love to hear what's been going on from your perspective and why you're excited to come here today.,104.12,109.559
SPEAKER_01," Well, I have a lot of negative stuff going on in my life right now.",110.06,113.638
SPEAKER_01, I've been very stressed lately because I lost my job pretty recently.,114.08,118.635
SPEAKER_01, It was a rough time and I haven't been handling it very well according to my husband.,120.08,125.699
SPEAKER_01, And he told me that I had to come to counseling where he would leave me.,126.161,129.532
SPEAKER_01,So that's why I'm here.,130.214,131.157
SPEAKER_00, I'm definitely glad that you came.,132.02,133.304
SPEAKER_00,When did you notice this change in yourself or notice that this was a problem?,134.447,138.539
SPEAKER_01," Well, I lost my job about a month ago.",139.261,141.129
SPEAKER_00,I got laid off a month ago.,141.149,142.373
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,144.521,145.864
SPEAKER_00,So it seems like losing your job has really affected your relationship with your husband and family.,145.984,152.419
SPEAKER_00," You said you have two other kids, that you love with them, right?",153.602,157.357
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I have two kids Max and Chelsea.",158.221,161.689
SPEAKER_01,"I love them a lot and we live all together, the four of us.",162.351,165.519
SPEAKER_01," The children are wonderful, but I feel like I haven't been a great mom recently to them or my husband.",166.421,173.0
SPEAKER_01, I think that's unfair to me.,173.202,174.515
SPEAKER_00, So that leads great into my next question.,175.603,177.191
SPEAKER_00,What's your relationship with your husband like?,177.231,178.779
SPEAKER_01," Well, we've had our ups and downs like every marriage.",181.282,187.554
SPEAKER_01,I spend a lot of time with the kids.,188.355,189.978
SPEAKER_01,He works a lot.,190.018,190.699
SPEAKER_01, He's not very close with the kids.,191.903,194.13
SPEAKER_01,But I'm not as close with my parents.,194.371,196.298
SPEAKER_01,I'm very close with my mom.,196.378,196.98
SPEAKER_01, And she's been there for me a lot in the past.,197.564,199.537
SPEAKER_00, Interesting.,200.0,200.222
SPEAKER_00,And how long have you been married for?,200.242,201.374
SPEAKER_00, Just seven years.,202.0,203.657
SPEAKER_00, And what do you like to do in your free time with your family?,205.141,208.032
SPEAKER_00,Do you spend time with them?,208.052,209.157
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I go to the gym a lot.",210.02,211.665
SPEAKER_01,That's more of an individual activity for me.,211.705,213.59
SPEAKER_01,It's something that releases a lot of my stress.,213.65,216.117
SPEAKER_01," And that's kind of how I, I don't know, it's part of who I am.",217.723,221.639
SPEAKER_01," But with the kids, I like them and I drive them all over the place all the time.",222.181,226.759
SPEAKER_01," I like to practice, I like to practice everything.",227.101,229.859
SPEAKER_01, So there's not a lot of time for me to really have time with my kids.,230.884,233.678
SPEAKER_01," But I don't know, I like to, you know, we read together every night.",234.0,239.476
SPEAKER_01,I try to make time for the kids.,239.496,240.98
SPEAKER_01, And I take them to the beach when it's warm.,241.421,243.448
SPEAKER_01,"You know, there's a lot of things that we do together.",244.171,246.478
SPEAKER_00," Good, good.",247.462,249.488
SPEAKER_00,Do you find you can draw support from your family?,249.528,251.395
SPEAKER_00,"You mentioned your aunt, but...",251.415,252.579
SPEAKER_01," Well, I don't really want to warn the kids because they think they're so young.",253.803,258.98
SPEAKER_01," And I think they know that something's up, but I don't really know to what extent they know.",259.683,263.88
SPEAKER_01, But I am closer to my aunt.,265.688,267.216
SPEAKER_01,She's always been there for me.,267.236,268.0
SPEAKER_01, But my husband and I have had a rough patch recently since I lost my job.,268.602,272.859
SPEAKER_00," So, when you're stressed, you sometimes go to your aunt, but do you turn to people for comfort?",274.341,279.779
SPEAKER_00, Or do you have an activity that helps you calm down or another method that helps you cope?,280.0,285.298
SPEAKER_01," Like I said, I have been going to the gym a lot, but I haven't been doing that as much recently.",286.02,290.92
SPEAKER_01," Maybe, I'm not really sure why I haven't made time for it.",291.0,294.635
SPEAKER_01,I haven't really felt like myself recently.,294.655,296.0
SPEAKER_01," But a lot of times, I turn to other things more than people.",296.201,300.438
SPEAKER_01, What kind of things do you mean?,301.482,302.506
SPEAKER_01,"Like substances, drugs and alcohol?",302.546,305.297
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I've never used them before, but I feel like it helps me relax, calm down.",306.521,313.599
SPEAKER_01," And a lot of times, it's something that I feel like I need to be, I guess, relaxed.",314.0,320.318
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,321.622,322.163
SPEAKER_00,Do you find that's affecting your family?,322.203,324.029
SPEAKER_00,Your relationships with them or the way you interact?,324.049,327.679
SPEAKER_01, It didn't for a while.,328.401,329.405
SPEAKER_01,"But like I said, about a month ago was a turning point.",331.09,333.619
SPEAKER_01," And when I lost my job, I do feel very ashamed.",334.762,340.514
SPEAKER_01,I made a horrible mistake the other day.,340.955,342.479
SPEAKER_01," I can't believe I'm saying this, but I drove with them in the car after I had a few drinks and they got pulled over.",343.742,348.679
SPEAKER_01, I felt like I endangered my family.,349.12,351.347
SPEAKER_01,I felt like I was being a bad mom and that was a really big life to me.,351.367,355.178
SPEAKER_00, That must have been pretty scary for you.,356.763,358.428
SPEAKER_00,"But if you think of it this way, it could be a turning point.",358.769,361.92
SPEAKER_00, And you now notice what you're doing wrong and how you can improve it.,362.361,367.0
SPEAKER_00, So it's progress that you're admitting that and that you do need to improve on certain things.,367.643,371.98
SPEAKER_00, Do you take any other medications?,373.067,374.436
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,375.626,376.03
SPEAKER_01, What medications?,377.283,378.253
, Oxycodone.,379.545,380.232
SPEAKER_01, And why do you have a prescription for that?,381.886,383.235
SPEAKER_01," Well, I had surgery a few years back and I got fulfilled.",384.1,389.128
SPEAKER_01,"I didn't really finish all the pills, but I've been taking them recently when I feel like I need to.",389.148,396.92
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,397.161,398.107
SPEAKER_00,And how often do you take them?,398.148,399.356
SPEAKER_01," I've taken three over the course of a month, but I know that I shouldn't be.",400.702,406.0
SPEAKER_00, How do you feel when you take them?,406.785,407.893
SPEAKER_01, It's numbing and it allows me to relax and escape from the issues in the home and workplace.,409.04,417.88
SPEAKER_01," I guess not really a workplace anymore, but I know that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing and I know that it's wrong.",418.622,425.94
SPEAKER_01, And I guess that's why I'm here.,427.289,428.295
SPEAKER_00, How has your family ever had a history of drug abuse problems and drinking?,429.0,432.477
SPEAKER_01," My dad, I think, was an alcoholic for a while, not really diagnosed.",433.181,438.957
SPEAKER_01, I grew up with a lot of that in the home.,440.721,443.046
SPEAKER_01,A lot of just genuine parents didn't mesh too well or a lot of infighting in the home.,443.106,450.699
SPEAKER_01," And the older I get, the more that I think that it might have been alcohol related on my father's part.",451.1,457.719
SPEAKER_01, My mother definitely not.,458.1,459.645
SPEAKER_01,"My father though, and I believe that his father had a problem similar to that as well.",460.528,463.819
SPEAKER_01, And is it the first time you found yourself turning to it?,464.483,466.98
SPEAKER_01," A few times in college I found myself depressed, confused about growing up, getting a career.",468.483,476.719
SPEAKER_01," I wasn't an addict in college, but I would do things with the intention of feeling better and forgetting.",477.441,484.98
SPEAKER_01, I think that's kind of something that's been beneath the surface for a while.,486.522,490.277
SPEAKER_01," When I find myself stressful, I can sink back into that.",491.943,496.94
SPEAKER_00, Have you ever experienced any form of sexual assault or abuse that maybe made you turn to alcohol?,498.524,503.579
SPEAKER_01, No.,504.163,504.286
SPEAKER_00, Are you having trouble eating or sleeping?,505.705,507.859
SPEAKER_01," Eating, yeah, not as much or as healthy as I have before, but sleeping absolutely because of stress.",510.083,516.98
SPEAKER_01, I find myself not sleeping as well.,517.687,518.838
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that definitely happens with stress.",519.904,521.53
SPEAKER_00,And what's a typical day like for you?,521.992,523.538
SPEAKER_01," Well, lately my husband's been taking care of the kids more because of last week and the incident with getting pulled over.",525.323,533.92
SPEAKER_01," He doesn't trust me with the kids, which I guess they understand.",534.161,537.176
SPEAKER_01," He doesn't trust me to drive kids places because of last week, so he usually will take them to school and I'll make him late for work and that makes him upset.",540.024,547.679
SPEAKER_01, And there's an argument there.,548.182,549.172
SPEAKER_01," When I wake up, I'll have a drink, so I'm not too hung up from the night before.",550.301,553.554
SPEAKER_01," Then I watch my show, I get the mail, and usually there's a bill, so I have a few more drinks.",555.883,560.839
SPEAKER_01," And then I try to start dinner, but it's usually hard because I'm pretty intoxicated, but I start dinner and usually at the night is the letter of a shit show and the kids are frustrated and you figure it out.",561.601,571.92
SPEAKER_00, And are you feeling sad or down in addition to being stressed?,573.106,575.819
SPEAKER_00, I'm pretty sad.,576.184,576.551
, Yeah.,577.0,577.531
SPEAKER_00," And when you're sad, do you turn to your faith?",579.084,582.334
SPEAKER_01,Have you been praying a lot?,582.375,583.398
SPEAKER_01," Some I used to, but I don't as much anymore.",584.722,587.668
SPEAKER_01,It's hard to believe that somebody's watching over me with all this negative stuff.,587.748,592.198
SPEAKER_00, Does other things give you hope besides your faith?,594.968,597.819
SPEAKER_01, The kids.,598.862,599.363
SPEAKER_01,Watching them play together and be together really gives me a lot of hope.,600.747,605.198
SPEAKER_01, I love seeing them do what they love to do and I love it when I know that what I do can enable them to enjoy their activities.,607.741,618.359
SPEAKER_01," But it's been hard to do that recently because I drive them to school, I've been taking them to activities because my husband's been doing this for me.",619.12,627.399
SPEAKER_01, So it's getting kind of empty-fills with them getting into the family.,628.101,631.598
SPEAKER_00, Thank you for sharing that.,633.04,634.03
SPEAKER_00, So we can start to meet on a regular basis and try to work through all these things together.,635.502,640.358
SPEAKER_00," From what I've collected, from what you kind of just told me, you're really stressed about losing your job and so you want to find different ways to cope with your stress.",641.801,651.599
SPEAKER_00," And then also try to rebuild the trust in your family, with your husband, your kids that they may have lost during the driving incident last week.",652.06,661.479
SPEAKER_01, Sounds a lot like what I want to do.,662.642,664.527
SPEAKER_01,I hope that you're able to help me with that.,664.567,667.034
SPEAKER_00," So in order for this to be most effective, let's brainstorm some small steps we can work on.",669.822,676.9
SPEAKER_00, Maybe make a list together and it can be very small unless it's not too overwhelming at first.,678.522,683.278
SPEAKER_00," So for instance, to work on the drinking thing, we can start by cutting down the number of drinks slowly today.",688.221,693.9
SPEAKER_00, And it can be really hard to just stop cold turkey because you can get withdrawal symptoms or it may make you even more stressed out.,694.401,701.98
SPEAKER_00, So I want you to be able to be confident in the goal you're setting and in yourself.,702.301,707.739
SPEAKER_00, So can you do one last drink each day or something like that.,708.02,713.94
SPEAKER_00," So what would you like to achieve from our work together in the future, by the end?",714.341,718.96
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I hear what you're saying.",719.06,722.256
SPEAKER_01,I understand.,722.276,722.739
SPEAKER_01, I guess I don't want to stop moving completely.,723.383,725.879
SPEAKER_01, But it sounds like a very logical solution at this point.,726.523,728.779
SPEAKER_01, It doesn't sound like something I'd be able to do at this point immediately.,729.121,731.94
SPEAKER_01, We can maybe get there.,732.181,734.131
SPEAKER_01,I'm not really sure if we can completely get there.,734.151,735.92
SPEAKER_01," And then after that, I'd really like to fix my relationship with my family.",737.145,740.98
SPEAKER_01," So if I go to my husband, we can patch things with my parents too.",741.804,745.0
SPEAKER_00, So let's start with a goal regarding drinking.,748.403,750.617
SPEAKER_00, What do you think is a reasonable thing for yourself?,751.323,752.98
SPEAKER_01," I can start having four drinks a day, maybe four maybe.",755.164,759.398
SPEAKER_00, That's good.,761.188,761.691
SPEAKER_00,That's a good one.,761.711,762.456
SPEAKER_00," Then in a few days you can try having three, and two, and one, until you don't need to turn to alcohol for comfort, and so on and so forth.",763.642,770.92
SPEAKER_00," If you need a different way to find comfort, you can try stress relieving activities.",772.726,776.94
SPEAKER_00, So what would be a good activity for you to do?,777.081,779.859
SPEAKER_01," I think I could try journaling, maybe drawing or painting.",781.743,784.735
SPEAKER_01,I did a lot of art in college.,784.755,785.819
SPEAKER_01, I'd really like to get back into that and I would just call it a day.,786.201,789.859
SPEAKER_00, That's a really great idea.,790.687,791.636
SPEAKER_00," Then in the future, what are you thinking regarding your career?",793.145,796.96
SPEAKER_01, I don't know.,798.464,799.768
SPEAKER_01,I don't think anyone's going to want somebody as dressed up as me right now.,799.788,803.499
SPEAKER_01, What was your old job again?,805.172,805.899
SPEAKER_01, I was a staff captain.,807.152,807.879
SPEAKER_00," Well, you don't need to jump right back into work again.",810.467,813.0
SPEAKER_00," That can be a way in the future, or maybe a month or two.",813.02,817.92
SPEAKER_00," If you think about it in the future, what would be your goal?",818.682,823.719
SPEAKER_01," I guess I'd like to get back in the game, but I think more important for me is that I patch things up with my family.",824.782,830.438
SPEAKER_01, But I do need to try making money again to support the family.,832.126,834.658
SPEAKER_01, It's not logical for me to assume that I can go a long time without it.,836.285,839.98
SPEAKER_01," That's why I want to fix my issues, get back in the job, and see what I can do.",840.361,846.619
SPEAKER_00, What kind of things do you think could help rebuild the trust within your family?,848.727,851.598
SPEAKER_01," I could block out some time each week to really spend a long time with each of my family members, my kids and my husband.",854.381,861.759
SPEAKER_01," Kids I don't think really understand what's going on, so I don't have to work as hard with them, but I would still love to.",863.103,868.739
SPEAKER_01," I just really do need to work in relationship with my husband, go back to what things we used to do together, and see what we can do to get back there.",869.801,880.78
SPEAKER_00, A way you could do that is try family therapy or couples counseling.,883.341,886.753
SPEAKER_00,Would you be interested in something like that?,887.274,888.88
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's definitely something we could do.",889.222,890.98
SPEAKER_00, Great.,891.581,892.983
SPEAKER_00,"So, I'm very happy that you came to talk to me today.",894.105,898.372
SPEAKER_00,"From what I heard, it sounds like losing your job has been incredibly stressful for you.",898.693,902.92
SPEAKER_00, And you turned to substance abuse to try and relieve some of that stress.,903.762,906.971
SPEAKER_00,Do you feel a little bit better after talking to me?,907.433,909.358
SPEAKER_01, I absolutely do.,910.461,911.042
SPEAKER_01,"I feel like the weight has really been lifted off my shoulders, and the fact that somebody is going to be in charge of my recovery, I think is huge.",911.082,918.9
SPEAKER_00," We'll definitely be working hand in hand, so you're in charge of your recovery, but I'm definitely here to help you along the way.",919.542,926.0
SPEAKER_00, I really am looking forward to our next session together.,926.302,929.98
SPEAKER_00, Me too.,930.02,930.265
SPEAKER_00, Great.,932.16,932.461
SPEAKER_00,"So, until our next session, I want you to try and journal every time that you're feeling upset or like you need to drink, stress, and then bring your journal and we can go through and find the times you felt like you needed substance to help you.",933.001,946.96
SPEAKER_00," And in addition to that, maybe try and cut back on your drinking, maybe one less glass or something of wine or anything for now.",947.781,957.715
SPEAKER_00,"And then next time, let me know how that goes.",958.957,960.88
