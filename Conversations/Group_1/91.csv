SPEAKER_01, Yes.,22.44,22.501
SPEAKER_01, What's been going on?,24.426,25.089

SPEAKER_01," So they actually said, Doug, we're going to take you to jail.",41.32,43.715
SPEAKER_01, From jail they just called me here.,44.44,45.529
SPEAKER_01, Do you know what you're charged with?,46.98,49.239
SPEAKER_01, They didn't explain anything.,50.268,51.439
SPEAKER_01, The government never explains anything.,51.52,53.115
SPEAKER_01, They just don't want me to understand what's going on because they just want to keep me  held in captivity.,53.6,57.448
SPEAKER_00, The government?,58.72,59.189
SPEAKER_00, Do you have anybody specific?,59.72,60.598
SPEAKER_01," No, it's the entire government.",61.687,63.178
SPEAKER_00, The entire government?,63.4,64.033
SPEAKER_00, The entire government.,64.4,65.4
SPEAKER_00, And how long have they been wanting to do this to you?,66.143,70.078
SPEAKER_01, All my life.,70.52,71.071
SPEAKER_01, They've done this all my life.,71.943,73.089

SPEAKER_01, Always there?,79.904,80.679
SPEAKER_01, Always there.,80.74,81.251
SPEAKER_01," Like for example, they're in the lights right now.",82.045,83.1
SPEAKER_01, They're listening to everything that we're talking about so that's the reason why I really  want to talk about what happened on the bus because they're just going to use that again  today and then it's going to lock me up again and make me take more minutes.,83.1,91.992
SPEAKER_00, You've been taking medications?,93.72,95.033
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I take the medication because if I don't take the medication, the government comes  and takes me away and puts me into a hospital where they force feed me the medication and  then the lights are always on and they can always hear everything that I'm saying and  what I'm thinking and what I'm going to do.",97.826,112.248
SPEAKER_00, Do you know what they want to do with that information?,114.96,118.035
SPEAKER_00, They want to use it to take over the world.,119.967,121.517
SPEAKER_01, To take over the world?,122.184,122.858
SPEAKER_01," To take over the world, of course.",123.041,124.173
SPEAKER_01, They want to use everything and use everything that everybody knows to use it against them  so that they can actually have the world that they want and that they need and make everybody  pretend that they don't know what's going on.,124.76,136.474
SPEAKER_01, So therefore they're using everybody's thoughts against themselves so that the government  can use it to their benefit.,137.38,144.747
SPEAKER_00, So what can you do in this situation?,147.36,151.179
, What do you mean?,153.39,153.973
,What can I do?,154.033,154.717
SPEAKER_00," Well, you said the government's monitoring everything and that they want to put you in  jail.",155.36,160.188
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,161.494,161.698
SPEAKER_00," If you don't take your medication, do you have any options?",161.8,165.56
SPEAKER_00, Are you stuck?,165.66,166.247
SPEAKER_01, No.,167.503,167.666
SPEAKER_01," When I'm home, I think I'm perfectly fine because I set up my house and my room to actually  make it government-approved so that nobody can actually hear or see what's going on in  there.",168.46,177.825
SPEAKER_01," So when I'm home, I'm perfectly fine.",178.56,180.776
SPEAKER_01, So one option is that being home.,181.36,184.259
SPEAKER_01," Being home, you're safe.",184.48,185.153
SPEAKER_01," Being home, I'm safe.",185.48,186.296

SPEAKER_01, My brother's safe.,188.786,189.439
SPEAKER_01, Everybody's safe.,189.684,190.337
SPEAKER_01," And being out in the world, I'm not safe.",191.344,193.756
SPEAKER_01, Nobody's safe.,194.623,195.174
SPEAKER_01, Are you safe here?,195.803,197.46
SPEAKER_01, No.,198.498,198.6
SPEAKER_01, I told you they are in the light and they can hear everything that we're saying right  now.,199.483,205.335
SPEAKER_01," So no, we're not safe here.",205.6,206.731
SPEAKER_00, So it's not safe here.,208.752,209.6
SPEAKER_00, It's not safe out in the world.,209.6,210.6
SPEAKER_00," At home, you're safe.",210.6,211.518
SPEAKER_00," At home, I'm safe in my room that I made government-approved.",212.222,215.655
SPEAKER_00," So if you could have your way, you would just stay home most of the time, all the time?",216.84,222.399
SPEAKER_01," I would stay home all of the time, but I can't stay home because I need to go and see doctors.",222.66,227.38
SPEAKER_01, And talk to people and do things that the government needs me or wants me to do.,228.4,232.34
SPEAKER_01, But I don't want to do those things because it's using my thoughts and they're trying  to use everybody against me.,232.48,239.997
SPEAKER_01, And I just can't deal with that.,240.761,242.629
SPEAKER_00, So how do you know that they're in the lights?,245.46,248.34
SPEAKER_00, How did you discover that?,249.165,250.071
SPEAKER_00, Everybody knows that they're in the lights.,252.145,253.635
SPEAKER_00, It's common knowledge?,254.543,255.4
SPEAKER_00, It's common knowledge.,255.42,256.216
SPEAKER_00, Do you ever hear things that other people can't hear or see things that other people  can't see?,258.323,263.687
SPEAKER_00," No, of course.",265.471,265.996
SPEAKER_01, Everybody hears the lights talking to you.,266.36,268.219
SPEAKER_01, I don't know what you're talking about.,268.441,269.754
SPEAKER_01," Like, everybody hears it.",270.38,271.39
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes it's a whisper for some people.,272.36,273.36
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes it's a yell.,273.605,274.34
SPEAKER_01," And if you want to not pay attention to what the lights are saying to you, then I don't  know what's wrong with you, but everybody can hear it.",274.4,281.36
SPEAKER_00, Everybody can hear it?,281.748,282.34
SPEAKER_00, Everybody can.,282.523,283.115
SPEAKER_01, What's it sound like to you?,283.36,284.34
SPEAKER_01, It just sounds like a robot talking.,285.421,287.219
SPEAKER_01, It sounds like we need to know this information.,288.385,291.159
SPEAKER_01, We need to...,291.32,291.749
SPEAKER_01, What are you doing?,292.643,294.138
SPEAKER_00," Oh, just making some notes.",294.34,295.411
SPEAKER_00, Just making some progress notes.,297.546,299.777
SPEAKER_00, Is it working?,301.472,301.936
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,304.422,304.667
SPEAKER_00, Where are your notes going to go?,306.025,307.192
SPEAKER_00," Well, this chart will get locked in the chart room down the hall.",309.365,312.139
SPEAKER_00, Who has access to the chart room?,313.442,314.27
SPEAKER_00, Mostly everybody works here.,316.126,317.213
SPEAKER_01, Oh.,318.623,318.987
SPEAKER_01, Can I get a copy of your notes after you're done?,320.984,323.396
SPEAKER_01, Does it worry that there's notes?,325.007,326.28
SPEAKER_01," Yes, because I might trust you, and I don't know if I do yet, but I don't trust the other  people who work here because I don't know if they're working for the government, which  they probably are working for the government.",326.722,336.28
SPEAKER_01," So they can actually have access to all of my notes and the things that you're writing  down, which I don't know what they are because you're not going to get me a copy of it yet.",336.903,343.918
SPEAKER_01," And I just don't trust that they can actually get that information in because they're going  to use it to their advantage, and they're going to give it to the government, which  I can't have that happening.",344.842,356.634
SPEAKER_01, So could you please not take notes?,357.24,358.876
SPEAKER_00, I can not take notes.,359.503,360.371
SPEAKER_00, What kind of information and notes are you worried that the government's going to get?,361.461,365.019
SPEAKER_01," Well, because I made my room at home government-proof, I think they're going to get a copy of my notes  and I'm going to try to steal that technology that I actually created so that they can then  disrupt my room and then everybody else's rooms who are just like mine so that they  can then use their mind control to then control me to do the things that they want me to do.",365.943,384.859
SPEAKER_00," So without the protection that your house offers, they could control your mind?",385.782,390.2
SPEAKER_01, Correct.,390.914,391.18
SPEAKER_01," Without my room and without the technology and the systems and the things that I created,  then the government will be able to control everything that I do.",391.742,401.634
SPEAKER_00, All right.,407.281,407.705
SPEAKER_00, So can you tell me about your mood through all this?,409.28,413.698
SPEAKER_00, So this sounds really stressful.,414.16,415.16
SPEAKER_00, You're describing an environment where the government's frequently looking at what you're doing.,415.16,421.438
SPEAKER_00, What are the feelings there?,423.589,424.16
SPEAKER_00, Do you feel sad or angry?,425.181,426.575
SPEAKER_00, I feel fine.,427.467,428.12
SPEAKER_00, You feel fine?,428.426,428.916
SPEAKER_01, I feel fine.,429.344,429.977
SPEAKER_01," I don't really have – yeah, I just feel fine.",431.406,434.08
SPEAKER_01," I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad.",434.847,436.1
SPEAKER_01, I just – I'm just here.,436.281,438.254
SPEAKER_01, Kind of resigned that the government's going to do this?,440.405,444.06
SPEAKER_01," Well, the government's going to do what they're going to do anyway, so it doesn't matter if  I'm happy, sad, pissed off, angry, any of that.",444.281,451.019
SPEAKER_01," The government's going to make me do what they want me to do anyway, so it doesn't matter how I feel.",452.1,457.696
SPEAKER_00, Are you worried that something is going to happen that's similar to what happened on the bus?,461.08,464.935
SPEAKER_01," No, because I've learned my lesson to not say those things out loud and to talk about  what the government's doing because I can't actually inform anybody else because nobody's  listening to me because they're already controlled by the government because they don't have a room like I do at home.",467.08,483.654
SPEAKER_00, So you avoid that in the future because it didn't really work?,486.321,489.075
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,490.591,490.795
SPEAKER_00, You weren't able to help them understand what's going on?,491.422,495.518
SPEAKER_01," Well, if people don't understand what's going on, then that's their fault and that's their problem.",497.04,501.0
SPEAKER_01, They should have listened to me.,501.222,502.171
SPEAKER_01, I could have actually gave them the technology that they needed to actually create the room  so that the government can't hear them.,503.442,510.253
SPEAKER_00, But they weren't open to that idea?,511.081,512.313
SPEAKER_00, No.,513.0,513.041
SPEAKER_00, Quite the opposite.,514.586,515.374
SPEAKER_00, Completely the opposite.,516.02,516.909
SPEAKER_00, How are your family relationships?,519.241,521.452
SPEAKER_00, How's that going?,524.041,524.449
SPEAKER_01, They're okay.,525.0,525.531
SPEAKER_01, I live with my mom.,526.465,527.212
SPEAKER_01, She does what she's supposed to.,528.545,529.737
SPEAKER_01," She doesn't go in my room because she knows that if she goes into the room, it's going to mess up the technology so she stays out.",530.08,535.639
SPEAKER_00, So you get along with her okay?,537.566,538.536
SPEAKER_00, We're fine.,539.869,540.374
SPEAKER_00, Anybody else you have contact with?,542.269,543.437
SPEAKER_00," Friends, family?",545.354,545.96
SPEAKER_01," No, just I talk to people all the time but they're just in my head.",546.823,550.86
SPEAKER_01, We have conversations all the time about how we can actually make the world a better place  and then how we can actually go through and then destroy the government.,551.582,559.417
SPEAKER_01," But yeah, I just talk to them in my head.",560.824,563.457
SPEAKER_00," Alright Jason, I'm sorry to hear that you're under stress.",566.96,571.378
SPEAKER_00, I'm glad to hear you feel like your mood's okay if you're not down or anxious or anything.,573.324,578.699
SPEAKER_00," This, answering these questions for me, this has been helpful  and I'm going to recommend you continue to see a counselor here if that's okay.",580.96,589.9
SPEAKER_00, I realize you're court ordered.,590.081,591.455
SPEAKER_00, Can this counselor be you?,591.96,593.334
SPEAKER_00, It could be me.,594.889,595.314
SPEAKER_00, Would that make you feel more comfortable?,596.96,598.839
SPEAKER_00, That would make me feel much better.,598.94,600.9
SPEAKER_00," Well then I'll put on the schedule, we'll set a time up front where I'll see you, let's say in three days.",600.92,607.419
SPEAKER_00, That works?,608.486,608.869
SPEAKER_00, Three days works.,609.92,610.526
SPEAKER_00, And we'll go from there.,612.183,613.839
SPEAKER_00, Thanks Jason.,613.94,614.405
