SPEAKER_01," Right, okay.",153.687,154.616

SPEAKER_01, And you've just said earlier that a whole lot of stuff's on your plate at the moment.,169.764,173.0

SPEAKER_01, Okay.,185.0,185.082
SPEAKER_01," So, Marsha, some counsellors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use  and we don't realise that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones.",186.622,196.719
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,197.02,197.184
SPEAKER_01, Here's the list here.,198.0,199.091
SPEAKER_01, Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment.,200.0,206.416
SPEAKER_00, I think number two.,208.242,209.172
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,210.061,210.673

SPEAKER_01," Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment, Marsha?",246.422,250.739
SPEAKER_00, Probably number four.,251.202,252.192
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,253.653,253.959
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,254.0,254.184
SPEAKER_01, How would you put that in your own words?,255.121,256.737
SPEAKER_00, That I need to be successful all the time in everything that I do.,257.563,260.94
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,261.081,261.303
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,263.224,263.571
SPEAKER_01, And is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment?,264.281,267.775
SPEAKER_00," Well, failing that exam, I mean, I wasn't successful with that.",269.241,272.859
SPEAKER_00," So, yeah, I mean, it just throws out, I guess even number two, because it throws out all the order in my life.",273.0,278.0
SPEAKER_00," I need to have everything, you know, so I need to know what I'm doing, where I'm going.",278.321,283.96
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, so.",284.101,284.747
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,286.571,286.816
SPEAKER_01," So if number four is an expectation that your family have and that you have of yourself, how do you measure up next to number four?",287.1,295.98
SPEAKER_00, I don't feel like I'm good enough.,296.828,298.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,298.327,298.469
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,299.347,299.653
SPEAKER_01, All right.,300.735,300.98
SPEAKER_01," Well, what I'd like to do is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC and I'll explain as we go along.",301.0,306.9
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,307.0,307.122
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,308.49,308.796
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,309.02,309.327
SPEAKER_01, So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment?,310.08,313.658
SPEAKER_00," I mean, there are a lot of things, but I think obviously failing the exam was the main one.",314.0,319.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,319.02,319.347
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,320.102,320.224
SPEAKER_01, All right.,321.041,321.857
SPEAKER_01, And the consequence is you thinking of leaving?,322.844,325.96
SPEAKER_00," I live in uni, yeah.",326.02,326.878
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,327.673,327.837

SPEAKER_01, And that statement that you made earlier about I'm not good enough.,329.864,333.0
SPEAKER_00," I'm not good enough, yeah.",333.0,333.98
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's the B one.",334.0,335.0
SPEAKER_01, That's the crucial one.,335.041,336.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,336.0,336.122
SPEAKER_01, And I'll explain it shortly when I get up to the board.,337.081,339.919
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,340.102,340.388
, All right.,341.02,341.959
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,342.041,342.143
SPEAKER_01, I think I'll put it up there now for you so we can work through that.,343.0,346.739
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,347.653,347.837
SPEAKER_01," So, Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier.",348.02,352.0
SPEAKER_00, I failed my exam.,352.545,353.616
SPEAKER_01, That's right.,354.12,354.681
SPEAKER_01, And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is?,365.02,368.216
SPEAKER_00, Leaving uni.,369.143,369.796
SPEAKER_01," That's right, yeah.",370.1,371.003
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,378.303,378.606
SPEAKER_01, So it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here and the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence.,380.2,392.279
SPEAKER_01, And you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit.,393.221,397.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,397.0,397.122
SPEAKER_01, And you put that in your own words.,398.02,398.959
SPEAKER_01, What were your words before?,399.0,399.939
SPEAKER_01, That I'm not good enough.,400.061,400.98
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, good.",401.08,401.561
SPEAKER_01, It's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking.,420.045,423.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,423.0,423.161
SPEAKER_01," Okay, Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board.",428.685,431.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,431.02,431.429
SPEAKER_01, And what I'd like to do now is focus stepping out a bit from your situation and looking at it from another point of view.,432.381,441.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,442.0,442.571
SPEAKER_01, To me it sounds like you're doing a whole lot of things really well.,444.305,448.0

SPEAKER_00," Things with my fiance, I mean, we're engaged, so planning the wedding.",462.607,467.0
SPEAKER_00, That's going really well.,467.04,468.717
SPEAKER_00," It's stressful, but it's going well.",469.747,471.0
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,471.0,471.143

SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah.",483.122,484.0
SPEAKER_01, And you're succeeding in all of those things.,485.047,486.94
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,487.0,487.327
SPEAKER_01, Put together.,488.082,488.918
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,489.408,489.735
SPEAKER_01," You're juggling it and it's a lot on your plate at the moment, but it sounds like you've been able to cope up until this point of the one exam.",490.18,499.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,499.02,499.388
SPEAKER_00, This one just threw me off balance.,500.525,502.0
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, just failing, yeah.",502.429,503.0

SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,512.367,512.612

SPEAKER_01, And what's the evidence for that?,514.0,514.869
SPEAKER_00, Passing all my exams all the time.,516.02,517.838
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,518.02,518.163
SPEAKER_00," Just passing my subjects, not just exams.",519.0,520.919
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's right.",521.0,522.0
SPEAKER_00," Getting that full-time job, it's a great job that I'm doing.",522.382,525.94
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,526.102,526.347
SPEAKER_00, You're getting married.,528.071,528.919
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's right.",529.388,529.98
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,530.0,530.306
, Yeah.,531.163,531.449
SPEAKER_01, So how do all of those successes compare to that belief that I've written on the board for you?,532.341,539.597

SPEAKER_01," Well, what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board.",563.065,566.0
SPEAKER_01, All right.,566.163,566.429
SPEAKER_01, To dispute that belief.,567.949,569.0

SPEAKER_00, Staying at uni.,606.01,606.758
SPEAKER_01, Good.,607.265,607.469

SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,643.531,643.755
SPEAKER_00, I feel like I should stay.,644.646,646.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,646.041,646.735
SPEAKER_01, Why is that?,647.848,648.354
SPEAKER_00, I can try again.,649.612,650.0
SPEAKER_00, Right.,650.0,650.102
SPEAKER_00," I mean, everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time.",651.0,652.993

SPEAKER_01, And we've talked about all your successes.,661.889,662.96
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,663.02,663.102
SPEAKER_01, So it's harder now to believe that top statement that I'm not good enough.,665.12,669.799
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,670.367,670.735
SPEAKER_00," I mean, I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize with all  the successes that I've had.",671.0,677.495

SPEAKER_01," What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement, I am good enough.",700.301,705.0
SPEAKER_01, Say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day so that you build up your confidence  because it's going to take some time to reprogram your computer up here with that kind of positive  belief about yourself rather than carrying around that other belief.,706.104,723.297
SPEAKER_01," And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years, and so it's going  to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief  system.",724.02,734.531
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,735.245,735.408
SPEAKER_01," But you've made a great start here today, so congratulations.",736.0,738.49
