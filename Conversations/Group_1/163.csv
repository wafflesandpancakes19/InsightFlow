SPEAKER_00," Hi Michelle, how are you doing today?",15.398,17.36
SPEAKER_01," I'm kind of doing, I'm feeling a little bit stressed out.",17.38,22.198
SPEAKER_00, Stressed?,23.027,23.333
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I feel like I have a lot on my plate.",24.564,26.391
SPEAKER_01, I have this test that I have to take for work.,28.76,31.978
SPEAKER_00, What kind of test?,32.32,32.728
SPEAKER_01, It's like an aptitude test.,33.704,34.997
SPEAKER_01, It has math problems on it and scenarios in order for me to move up to the assistant manager  position.,35.761,43.492
SPEAKER_00," Right, and that's a job that you've been interested in for a while.",44.503,47.018
SPEAKER_00," Yes, it is.",47.38,47.952
SPEAKER_01, That's what you've been talking about.,48.36,49.34
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,49.462,50.013
SPEAKER_01," So, I've been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually  scheduled for me to take the test and I just got really overwhelmed and I started, I felt  my heart was racing, I felt like my hands were shaking and I just really couldn't concentrate  on the test even though the night before me and my friend did practice problems and  I knew all the answers with no problem, like I didn't miss any of the questions.",50.44,88.735
SPEAKER_00, You know the material on this test pretty well.,90.28,92.956
, Yes.,94.171,94.579
SPEAKER_00," But the feelings and that physiological response to heart rate and the sweating, the feelings  of anxiety plus those physiological responses, they got in the way of you completing it,  if you were able to complete it?",94.881,107.738
SPEAKER_01," No, I wasn't able to complete it and thankfully they gave me a chance to come back.",107.981,111.699
SPEAKER_01, I just told them I didn't feel well.,111.84,113.193
SPEAKER_01, So they rescheduled.,113.92,114.859
SPEAKER_01, So now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety because I'm scared the same thing is going to happen  when I go back.,115.583,120.712
SPEAKER_00, All right.,123.115,123.519
SPEAKER_00, So you weren't feeling great about taking the test in the first place?,123.6,126.775
SPEAKER_01," The day, the night before I felt like I know all the answers but the minute I walked into  the room, all of a sudden all these fears kind of took over.",127.72,137.117
SPEAKER_00, But did you know that was coming?,137.96,139.759
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,140.513,140.758
SPEAKER_00, You did?,140.983,141.33
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,141.922,142.126
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,143.003,143.33
SPEAKER_00, So you had some anxiety in advance?,143.84,144.799
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,145.677,145.84
SPEAKER_00, Or not?,146.187,146.452
SPEAKER_00, You did?,146.86,147.758
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,147.84,147.983
SPEAKER_01," I had some anxiety the day before but when I reviewed it with my friend, I'm like, oh,  I know the answers.",148.88,154.156
SPEAKER_01," I thought that would kind of push it down but I think once I got there, it all came  back up to the surface.",154.36,162.22
SPEAKER_00, It erupted in that moment and that prevented you.,162.82,164.833
SPEAKER_00, What do you think is leading to this?,165.96,168.737
SPEAKER_01," Well, I've always kind of struggled with tests.",169.942,173.213
SPEAKER_01," Like I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test because I was really  struggling in math.",175.6,185.449
SPEAKER_01, And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade.,187.08,191.396
SPEAKER_01, And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it.,192.64,195.517
SPEAKER_01, I had to tutor and I felt really prepared for it.,196.02,198.474
SPEAKER_01," And then when I took it, I failed and I was held back.",199.54,203.815
SPEAKER_01," And I feel like, you know, that was so, it was really embarrassing for me to be held  back.",205.3,211.226
SPEAKER_01," I felt like, I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time because I  felt like I really did know this so I don't know why I couldn't pass the test.",212.04,220.673
SPEAKER_00," And since that, so this was third grade?",222.52,224.396
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,225.043,225.411
SPEAKER_00," And since that, they had testing experience.",225.88,228.54
SPEAKER_00, Have you had trouble with tests since?,229.346,230.92
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,231.327,231.47
SPEAKER_01, I always feel really anxious.,232.081,233.473
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from grade school and went on  to high school.",234.4,241.635
SPEAKER_01," But it's so hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I  know it, I may still fail the test anyway.",242.462,250.92
SPEAKER_01, Maybe like a repeat of what happened.,251.162,252.772
SPEAKER_00, All right.,255.055,255.319
SPEAKER_00," So in third grade, you had a really bad testing experience.",255.601,259.052
SPEAKER_00," And as you moved forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests.",261.6,266.879
SPEAKER_00, No.,267.1,267.284
SPEAKER_00, But you've been able to adapt.,268.32,270.939
SPEAKER_00, You've been able to take them and still pass them.,271.08,274.918
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,275.422,275.687
SPEAKER_01," I mean, sometimes I get an A.",276.42,277.847
SPEAKER_00," That's good, right?",280.541,281.174
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,281.5,281.766
SPEAKER_01," I mean, yeah, it is good.",282.562,283.48
SPEAKER_01," But yeah, it's good.",283.48,284.194
SPEAKER_00, All right.,284.541,285.48
SPEAKER_00," But with this particular test, which is not for school, which is for work, this one, this  is more a stumbling block for you.",285.48,293.026
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,297.719,297.8
SPEAKER_00, Do you have any ideas as to what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you?,297.8,305.258
SPEAKER_01, I think it's just the fact that it's this promotion.,306.021,307.858
SPEAKER_01, It's almost like the same thing.,308.04,309.129
SPEAKER_01," If I fail, I'm being held back.",310.4,311.898
SPEAKER_01, And I feel like it's reliving that moment of being held back.,312.401,315.856
SPEAKER_01," And that's like a fear that I have that by not being able to pass these tests, they're  holding me back.",316.921,323.595
SPEAKER_00, All right.,324.186,324.533
SPEAKER_00," So really that same feeling you had in third grade, that's coming up with this test now.",324.9,331.52
, Yeah.,331.7,332.292
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I didn't put them together until now, but yeah.",333.524,335.634
SPEAKER_00," And the other test you'd taken throughout the rest of grade school and high school,  they didn't have that same value attached to them.",336.82,345.255
SPEAKER_01," No, because they didn't have all that pressure that it was either win or lose, basically.",346.0,352.338
SPEAKER_00, You could take them again or take that course again.,353.0,355.014
SPEAKER_01, Or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn't do good on that test.,355.88,360.439
SPEAKER_00, So you maybe had more options in school.,361.223,363.499
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,363.68,363.864
SPEAKER_01, It wasn't pass or fail.,364.761,366.293
SPEAKER_00, So it's the pressure.,367.141,368.738
SPEAKER_00, It's the pressure of you need to get through this.,368.96,371.012
SPEAKER_00, You don't have the safety nets that you had in school.,372.32,375.32
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,375.585,375.708
SPEAKER_01," If I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion.",376.32,379.66
SPEAKER_01, I would have to wait just like I did.,379.72,381.259
SPEAKER_01," I'm going to have to wait a certain amount of time, I think an year before I could take  it again.",381.8,385.049
SPEAKER_00, All right.,386.11,386.498
SPEAKER_00, So that is a lot of pressure.,386.6,387.355
SPEAKER_01, That is a lot of pressure.,387.824,388.6
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it is.",388.6,389.273
SPEAKER_00, So is there any time limit to this test for work?,390.503,394.558
SPEAKER_01," No, there isn't.",395.745,397.018
SPEAKER_00, There's no time limit?,397.322,398.24
SPEAKER_01, No.,398.403,398.567
SPEAKER_00," And how many, is it like a multiple choice?",399.24,401.64
SPEAKER_00," Yes, it is.",402.007,402.497
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,402.783,402.967
SPEAKER_00," And you seem like, like you said you were studying the night before with your friend.",403.861,407.24
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,407.504,407.667
SPEAKER_00, You're really well prepared for it.,408.32,409.295
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,410.498,410.6
SPEAKER_00, So I have a few thoughts about this.,410.941,412.914
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,414.309,414.452
SPEAKER_00," One is I'm wondering, you know, we've talked before about cognitive therapy, about the  core beliefs.",415.864,420.644
SPEAKER_00," So I'm curious as to what you think about like what core belief may be operating for  you now with this test, this work test.",423.12,435.313
SPEAKER_01," That I could fail, and then if I fail, I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the  things that I try.",437.4,442.556
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,443.087,443.291
SPEAKER_00," So something like I'm a failure or I'm bound to be a failure, I'm destined to be a failure.",443.76,450.46
SPEAKER_01, I would say like I'm destined to be a failure.,450.541,452.439
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,453.112,453.296
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,453.683,453.908
SPEAKER_00, So I'm destined to be a failure.,454.52,455.52
SPEAKER_00," So that potentially is a core belief, right, that's operating.",455.64,461.48
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,461.601,461.784
SPEAKER_01," I mean, that's what scares me.",462.56,464.359
SPEAKER_01," That's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test, that if I  don't pass it, it's just going to have like this domino effect of failure.",464.48,471.199
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,471.626,471.851
SPEAKER_00," So it could be a core belief, but it's also, it seems like it's still an automatic thought.",472.32,476.778
SPEAKER_00," Like as you get ready to take that test, you're thinking, I'm destined to be a failure.",477.441,482.056
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,484.298,484.44
SPEAKER_00," And you're having what sounds like a panic response, right, with the heart racing.",484.48,489.759
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, and my hands shaking.",490.0,491.718
SPEAKER_00, Hands shaking.,492.287,492.96
SPEAKER_00, Are you in the room alone when you're taking the test?,492.96,495.237
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,495.884,496.047
SPEAKER_00, You are.,497.415,497.66
SPEAKER_00," So no one's really seeing you have this, I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet.",497.68,502.898
SPEAKER_00," We haven't really gotten that far into it, but it sounds like it has some panic-like  features.",503.44,507.55
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,508.264,508.427
SPEAKER_00," Because it's not, it's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get through the  items.",510.766,515.024
SPEAKER_00, So okay.,515.96,516.767
SPEAKER_00," So one thought I have is, have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like  this?",518.12,525.767
SPEAKER_00, Only when I'm...,526.767,527.297
SPEAKER_00, Other than the third grade thing?,527.683,528.597
SPEAKER_01," No, not really.",529.187,529.738
SPEAKER_01," I mean, sometimes I get worked up when I'm about to take a test.",529.88,532.179
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,532.546,532.75
SPEAKER_01, But it's only around tests.,533.24,534.438
SPEAKER_00, And what happens once you get worked up?,535.004,536.779
SPEAKER_00," Like once your heart rate increases and you have the other physiological symptoms, what...",536.92,542.358
SPEAKER_01, When I actually do take the test?,543.08,544.75
SPEAKER_01, I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to  get to the last question.,546.7,554.43
SPEAKER_00," So one possible strategy here is, we talked about the adaptive response, right?",555.98,562.8
SPEAKER_00," So which is that thought that you say to yourself, that self-talk.",562.94,566.657
SPEAKER_00," I wonder if your adaptive response couldn't be, I can ride this out.",567.48,571.659
SPEAKER_00, Like you have no time to go on a test.,571.84,573.214
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's true.",573.861,574.453
SPEAKER_00," I mean, the panic response is only maintained for so long.",574.82,578.517
SPEAKER_01, And I could also choose maybe questions that I know the answer to automatically.,579.18,582.92
SPEAKER_01, So that could help maybe relieve some of that stress.,583.281,587.358
SPEAKER_00," To get some, in a sense, to get some minor victories under your belt by answering those  right, you know you're closer to achieving your goal.",587.92,595.9
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,595.94,596.042
SPEAKER_01," And then I feel like I know, at least I know that they'll validate the feeling that maybe  I can pass this test.",597.101,603.175
SPEAKER_00," So the more items you answer correctly, the less anxious you're going to feel because  you're closer to the end of.",604.981,613.432
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, definitely.",614.222,615.12
SPEAKER_01," Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that, I know these questions are definitely  going to be right.",615.321,621.226
SPEAKER_00," So that's one, well that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right?",623.201,628.32
SPEAKER_00, Like you can wait out the panic.,628.501,630.82
SPEAKER_00," I mean, you're in the room alone.",630.86,632.679
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's true.",633.103,633.797
SPEAKER_01, Nobody's there.,633.94,634.389
SPEAKER_01, Nobody's going to see me if I'm kind of trying to get myself together.,634.94,637.878
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,638.403,638.546
SPEAKER_00," Now the panic's painful, right?",639.26,640.952
SPEAKER_00, The panic symptoms are painful.,642.18,643.393
SPEAKER_00," So what you could tell yourself is, yeah, this is unpleasant, but I can ride out these  symptoms because they only last so long.",644.1,651.039
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,651.467,651.835
SPEAKER_01, So I could use like self-talk.,652.363,653.898
SPEAKER_01, Exactly.,654.753,655.08
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,655.345,655.631
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,656.263,656.345
SPEAKER_00," Because usually I mean panic symptoms can run, you know, five minutes, 10 minutes, 15  minutes, but you have no time limit.",657.14,661.259
SPEAKER_01," So I can take a, yeah.",662.245,663.78
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,663.841,663.923
SPEAKER_00," So if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, that  you could get right and kind of at the same time be telling yourself, I can ride this  out.",664.82,677.085
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,678.024,678.208
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I've done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test.",679.322,682.775
SPEAKER_00, So that's worked for you?,684.161,684.957
SPEAKER_01, That has worked for me in the past.,685.12,686.1
SPEAKER_01," Yes, that has worked for me in the past.",686.1,687.29
SPEAKER_00," So that's certainly one adaptive response to try, right?",688.62,695.297
SPEAKER_00," Another one could be that although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test  in a year, right?",696.6,704.82
SPEAKER_00, You could try again.,704.84,705.371
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's true.",705.881,706.452
SPEAKER_00," I mean, I know that's not what you want, but the alternative is kind of buying into that  automatic thought.",707.201,713.935
SPEAKER_00," We know that's not working, right?",714.2,716.094
SPEAKER_00," I'm destined, that was the word, right?",717.56,719.119
SPEAKER_00, Like I'm destined to be a failure.,719.24,720.369
SPEAKER_00, We know that's not working for you.,721.8,722.892
SPEAKER_01," So even if I have to take the test again in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure  because I still have the chance to take it again.",723.62,731.698
SPEAKER_01, It's not like I'll never be able to take this test again.,731.92,734.597
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, you just have another year to study, right?",735.903,739.295
SPEAKER_00," And of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time, and that would be an outcome I  know you don't want, but it's not the end of your career.",740.84,748.717
SPEAKER_00," It's not like something so drastic, right?",749.44,752.219
SPEAKER_00," It's important to you, and I can appreciate that, but it's not the end of your career.",752.32,756.8
SPEAKER_00, You're not going to be unemployed.,756.901,758.317
SPEAKER_01," No, no, definitely not.",758.761,760.093
SPEAKER_01," And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay  back, I still managed to do well the next year and keep moving up.",761.161,769.999
SPEAKER_01," And it hasn't really, in the long run, prevented me from doing anything that I wanted to do.",770.74,775.318
SPEAKER_00, So that's great.,775.76,776.168
SPEAKER_00," That's another adaptive response, which is I've survived this before.",776.76,779.798
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I definitely have.",780.401,782.031
SPEAKER_00," So this one event, I mean, I know you had the incident in third grade with the unpleasant  experience, but this one event, you don't want to let this kind of fashion, well, use  your word, your destiny, right?",783.56,798.439
SPEAKER_00," This was one unpleasant event that seemed to catch you off guard with the panic-like  symptoms, and fortunately, your employer is going to give you a chance to try this again.",798.64,810.734
SPEAKER_00," I imagine you can ride out these symptoms, and I think you have the other adaptive response,  which is I've been successful with this before.",813.72,823.056
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,823.62,823.722
SPEAKER_01," Definitely, I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I've  been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to that feeling that I'm going  to just fail altogether.",824.6,837.233
SPEAKER_00," All right, so what we'll do is, when do you have to take the test?",839.345,841.936
SPEAKER_01," Next week, next Wednesday.",843.061,843.98
SPEAKER_00, Next week.,844.041,844.959
SPEAKER_00," All right, so let's schedule one more appointment right before that.",845.02,848.397
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,848.96,849.266
SPEAKER_00, We'll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you're ready to go.,850.06,855.158
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,855.881,856.309
SPEAKER_00," And really, we'll kind of focus on the positive outcome, right?",857.342,862.66
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,862.68,862.843
SPEAKER_00," Which is just taking this test, taking one item at a time, and fighting through some  of these physical symptoms you're having.",863.68,871.256
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,871.74,871.965
SPEAKER_00, And fighting through the unuseful thoughts.,872.74,875.14
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,875.71,875.976
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,876.343,877.078
SPEAKER_01," I mean, that sounds good because it helped me prepare for the test.",877.48,880.255
SPEAKER_00, Great.,881.648,882.118
SPEAKER_00," So, Michelle, I'll see you then and we'll work through it.",882.26,885.919
SPEAKER_00, I really appreciate you coming in today.,886.141,887.639
SPEAKER_01," Okay, thank you.",887.822,888.478
