SPEAKER_00, I got that situation.,257.727,258.677
SPEAKER_00, Tell me about a situation at school where your alarm center is like going off.,263.048,268.98
SPEAKER_01," My history teacher, sometimes just looking at her, she just has this attitude, she's not walking in.",269.341,275.451
SPEAKER_01," And then, but I mean it's such a boring teacher, so I tend to sleep in class and I can't help it.",281.16,292.98
SPEAKER_01, And then she'll call me out for the whole class.,295.307,297.799
SPEAKER_01, And it just makes me mad.,300.452,301.879
SPEAKER_01," And we'll start going back and forth saying stuff and it goes, I end up cussing her out.",303.723,311.76
SPEAKER_01, And that's when I had to go to attention.,312.925,315.899
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,316.02,316.265
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,317.163,317.551

SPEAKER_00, When you're in bad anxiety.,342.667,343.98
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,344.041,344.98
SPEAKER_00," Like maybe, yeah, if you ever get anxious where you just kind of freeze, or yours are more of a reactive of a fight, of a lash out, of a get it out.",345.1,361.78
SPEAKER_00, That's kind of your response.,362.224,363.0
SPEAKER_01," I don't want to feel something, I have to get it out.",363.0,364.859

SPEAKER_00, I think that's good.,373.02,373.918

SPEAKER_00," You're trying to be very conscientious about what's going on around you, how you're feeling, and how you're going to react.",407.481,415.98
SPEAKER_00," Instead of just reacting, when that alarm goes off, you're going to think about it, name it, and then react.",417.222,426.96
SPEAKER_00," Hopefully, maybe we can get a little bit more control on anger reactions coming.",427.822,433.396

SPEAKER_00, And I need that.,436.367,436.878

SPEAKER_00, Sometimes we don't have a lot of time.,508.061,509.98
SPEAKER_00," You know, it's great when you can take 15 minutes to calm down, maybe you're going to bed at night, and you're doing something that makes you calm down, and it's quiet, but a lot of time, in the heat of the moment, we don't have a lot of time.",510.34,524.96
SPEAKER_00," Or when you feel that anger rising, there's not a lot of time, all right?",525.583,528.96
SPEAKER_00, It happens.,529.286,529.735
SPEAKER_00, It happens a lot.,530.612,531.0

SPEAKER_00, So S-T-O-P.,539.604,541.758
SPEAKER_00," So it means, the first, the S, is to stop.",542.583,545.98
SPEAKER_00," So, for example, you're watching TV, and your mom says, Alyssa, can you do this, please?",546.561,553.599
SPEAKER_00, All right.,554.633,554.878
SPEAKER_00," Right then and there, you're going to say, okay, stop, and then you're going to take a breath.",555.982,562.298
SPEAKER_00, Okay?,563.857,563.98
SPEAKER_00," You're going to breathe in, breathe deeply, and you're going to breathe out.",564.02,568.076

SPEAKER_00," You're getting a lot of oxygen in your brain, which really helps you think better.",595.523,598.0
SPEAKER_00, All right?,598.143,599.0
SPEAKER_00," So you're breathing in, getting that oxygen right there.",599.06,601.98
SPEAKER_00, All right.,602.0,602.857
SPEAKER_00, The O means observe.,603.423,605.779
SPEAKER_00, What is going on around you right now?,606.664,608.859

SPEAKER_00, That's how you would like it.,622.0,623.0
SPEAKER_00," It may not be how mom would like it, but you might be able to, if you can kind of get, observe the situation and how you're feeling.",623.842,633.0
SPEAKER_00, I'm a little mad.,633.0,634.0
SPEAKER_00, Mom just asked me to do it.,634.0,635.0

SPEAKER_00, All right?,640.122,640.429
SPEAKER_00, Watching the show.,641.041,642.0
SPEAKER_00, I'm getting frustrated that she's asking me to do this right now.,642.965,645.98
SPEAKER_00," Observe it, name it, claim it, and say, okay, that's how I'm feeling right now.",646.582,651.917

SPEAKER_00," And then the, so the O is for observe.",661.265,664.578
SPEAKER_00, And the P is for proceed.,665.322,667.94
SPEAKER_00, That means move forward.,668.082,669.0
SPEAKER_00, But something that's going to benefit you.,670.128,671.94
SPEAKER_00, That's going to be positive.,672.306,673.0
SPEAKER_00, That's going to work for you.,673.0,674.98
SPEAKER_00, Yelling at your mom.,675.02,676.879
SPEAKER_00, Is that working for you?,677.224,677.98

SPEAKER_00, So we're going to proceed with something that's going to work for you.,690.04,692.96
SPEAKER_00," In this situation, do you have an idea that might work for you?",694.284,699.679
SPEAKER_01," Um, I mean I just talk to her, but it's just so hard to talk to her without yelling.",701.621,711.619
SPEAKER_01," But I mean I guess if I stopped, I wouldn't be like quite so mad.",712.0,717.797
SPEAKER_01, So I just tell her that.,719.482,722.618
SPEAKER_01, I'm going to do it later.,723.061,724.758
SPEAKER_01, But I mean I see her get pissed off about that.,725.465,726.859
SPEAKER_01, I just want to get that out.,727.222,728.919
SPEAKER_00, But it's a good idea though.,729.302,731.734
SPEAKER_00, It's a good thought.,733.0,733.612
SPEAKER_00, It might be worth a try to say.,734.584,737.0
SPEAKER_00," And maybe it's more instead of telling her I'm going to do it later, saying,  Mom, I've got ten more minutes with this show.",737.442,743.758
SPEAKER_00, Here's ten more minutes.,744.429,745.0

SPEAKER_00, Kind of put it in a question.,751.081,752.96
SPEAKER_00," So instead of saying, I'm going to do it later, say, I just got ten more minutes  and I really want to finish this show.",753.742,761.212
SPEAKER_00," Is it okay if I just do the dishes as soon as, in ten minutes when I finish this show?",762.08,768.378
SPEAKER_00, Does that sound like something that maybe?,769.846,771.255
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean that's what I said before, but I mean I was kind of,  I probably won't have liked the way I was saying it and stuff like that.",772.161,779.879
