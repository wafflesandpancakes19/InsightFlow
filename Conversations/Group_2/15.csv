SPEAKER_01,"If they needed a certain day off, they need to go through the order of command and ask for a day off.",81.907,87.758
SPEAKER_00, And they didn't do that and said they asked you to switch days.,89.262,91.497
SPEAKER_01, And then they called me inflexible because I got upset about it.,91.92,94.39
SPEAKER_00, In what way did you get upset?,97.526,98.536
SPEAKER_01," Well, I told them.",99.522,100.444

SPEAKER_00, Anything else that your boss may have as a reason for...?,129.241,133.493
SPEAKER_01," They call me a perfectionist because I like the things done by the book, which I think makes me a great worker.",136.141,142.158
SPEAKER_01, Because I get everything done on deadlines.,142.92,146.43
SPEAKER_01,"Not before, not after.",146.691,147.994
SPEAKER_01,Right on the deadline.,148.356,149.138

SPEAKER_01, The whole day has a schedule.,210.243,211.907
SPEAKER_01,And I meet that schedule.,212.629,213.712
SPEAKER_01,And it's the best thing for me.,214.093,215.236
SPEAKER_00, All right.,217.782,218.644
SPEAKER_00,So this is frustrating for you that your coworkers can't understand where you're coming from?,218.784,225.92
SPEAKER_01, I just don't get it.,227.442,228.243
SPEAKER_01,"You know, I'm doing everything by the book, by the rules.",228.464,232.329
SPEAKER_01,And I'm in trouble somehow?,233.25,235.794
SPEAKER_01,Something's wrong with me because I do it right.,236.135,239.92
SPEAKER_01, I do it the right way and that's wrong somehow.,240.101,243.816
SPEAKER_01,And I don't get it.,244.036,244.599
SPEAKER_00," Have you ever had to work in a group, like a team with any of your coworkers?",246.04,252.338
SPEAKER_01, They've made me.,253.844,255.43
SPEAKER_01,But I don't like it.,255.791,257.338
SPEAKER_01, Tell me.,258.451,258.757
SPEAKER_01, Because I know the way we need to do things.,260.863,262.205
SPEAKER_01,"If we're given a project, okay.",263.246,265.109
SPEAKER_01,"It starts with A, B, C, D, and then no.",265.91,269.796
SPEAKER_01,"Everybody wants, oh, let's do C, O, D, and then F.",269.896,272.78
SPEAKER_01, No.,273.762,273.963
SPEAKER_01,"No, no, no.",274.524,275.005
SPEAKER_01,"A, B, C, D. There is no deviation from that.",275.807,278.293
SPEAKER_01,And then they get mad at me.,279.476,280.318
SPEAKER_00, So working in groups hasn't worked out too well for you?,283.081,286.719
SPEAKER_01, Not really.,287.885,288.548
SPEAKER_01,Not unless people listen to me.,288.608,290.518
SPEAKER_00," So in instances where people listen to you, how have things worked out?",291.623,295.036
SPEAKER_01," If I oversee everything, I still get uncomfortable because they're out of my sight.",296.901,302.89
SPEAKER_01,I don't know what they're doing sometimes.,302.91,304.412
SPEAKER_01,"I have to watch one person, other person's over there.",304.713,308.278
SPEAKER_01,I don't know what they're doing.,308.298,309.62
SPEAKER_01," And if it's not done right, it's not done right.",310.983,315.255
SPEAKER_01,And that's bad.,315.516,316.579
SPEAKER_00, Can you tell me anything about your mood in general in terms of have you felt sad or anxious?,320.244,327.996
SPEAKER_00,Anything like that recently?,328.016,329.999
SPEAKER_01, Not particularly.,331.96,332.982
SPEAKER_01,I guess I feel anxious sometimes when things aren't going the way they need to go.,333.602,338.99
SPEAKER_01,Because then it puts off the whole day.,339.511,341.694
SPEAKER_01,And I guess I would consider that anxiety.,341.714,342.896
SPEAKER_01," Because if it's not going the right way, one thing goes wrong, the whole day is thrown off.",346.261,350.609
SPEAKER_01,And then now I have to deal with that.,351.61,352.772
SPEAKER_01,"Now I have to adjust my whole schedule, even by a minute.",352.813,355.397
SPEAKER_01,And that does cause me anxiety.,355.858,356.88
SPEAKER_00, Even by a minute?,357.553,357.92
SPEAKER_01, Even by a minute.,357.981,359.334
SPEAKER_00," So if your day is not going the way you planned it for it to go, you're feeling some anxiety from that?",361.541,369.86
SPEAKER_01, Absolutely.,370.41,370.859
SPEAKER_00, Does your employer ever have unscheduled meetings or anything like that that happens?,372.184,377.92
SPEAKER_01, He does.,378.641,379.242
SPEAKER_01,He will schedule some unscheduled meetings.,379.262,382.406
SPEAKER_01,"And I've calmly, I've tried to calmly approach him and say, you know, there's a meeting, we need to know about it.",382.627,390.198
SPEAKER_01,I need to schedule my day around the meeting.,390.678,391.92
SPEAKER_01," He once scheduled a meeting at 12.20 and I told him, I'm at lunch 12 to 12.30.",393.102,400.075
SPEAKER_01,Why do you think that's appropriate?,401.618,402.86
SPEAKER_01," I mean, sometimes I feel like I'm the only smart person there.",404.0,405.868
SPEAKER_01,I'm the only person who knows how this needs to run.,405.888,408.579
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so you have some different stressors at work.",412.201,414.186
SPEAKER_00,And some disagreements with your co-workers.,416.03,417.835
SPEAKER_00,Can you tell me anything about your home life?,418.577,419.88
SPEAKER_01, I personally consider my home life very neat.,423.604,425.267

SPEAKER_01,Everything's where it needs to be.,429.354,430.276
SPEAKER_01,I have my meals scheduled out.,430.296,432.018
SPEAKER_01,I have a nice little calendar.,432.039,432.92
SPEAKER_01, Everything's planned.,434.143,435.967
SPEAKER_01,"Thursday's chicken, Fridays, tamales, and so on and so forth.",436.127,439.855
SPEAKER_00, So your home life's a bit like your work life in terms of being organized.,442.924,446.9
SPEAKER_01, That's the right way to do it.,447.869,448.738
SPEAKER_00," Do you ever, in terms of your home life, do you ever collect anything?",450.001,452.839
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I do.",454.708,455.193
SPEAKER_00, Tell me about that.,456.002,456.859
SPEAKER_01, I guess that does also cause me some anxiety because I do like to collect things.,459.962,466.351
SPEAKER_01,"If I have a good day, I like to keep the newspaper on the day that I had a good day.",467.854,471.9
SPEAKER_01, And I have newspapers from years ago.,474.744,477.129
SPEAKER_01,But no important news online.,478.071,479.495
SPEAKER_01,But I just can't seem to let it go.,480.557,481.92
SPEAKER_00, So you keep them in your home?,484.002,484.9
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,486.287,486.491
SPEAKER_00," So newspapers, anything else that you collect?",487.544,489.417
SPEAKER_00, Receipts.,490.165,490.532
SPEAKER_00, Receipts?,490.92,491.247
SPEAKER_01," Well, it says to keep, I mean, I've always known you have to keep receipts.",492.421,497.67
SPEAKER_01,You don't know when you're ever going to have to prove that you purchased something or when you have to return something.,498.611,503.92
SPEAKER_00, So what percentage of the receipts that you're given do you think that you keep?,506.041,508.86
SPEAKER_00, All of them.,508.961,509.185
SPEAKER_00, All of them?,509.92,510.716
SPEAKER_01, Every single one.,511.542,512.103
SPEAKER_01,"I get very upset if I go to McDonald's or Food Fast Food Place, I want my receipt.",512.183,517.095
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,521.843,522.103
SPEAKER_00,I'm going to ask you some questions.,522.644,525.588
SPEAKER_00,"We'll go back to work, kind of regarding your work schedule.",527.19,530.635
SPEAKER_00,Do you wash your hands regularly at work?,530.695,533.92
SPEAKER_01, I wash my hands before I eat.,535.561,538.166
SPEAKER_01,After I eat.,538.847,540.731
SPEAKER_01,After I use the restroom for 30 seconds.,542.053,545.139
SPEAKER_01,Every time.,545.459,545.74
SPEAKER_00, Do you ever find yourself like having washed your hands and then going back and washing them several other times?,547.141,551.599
SPEAKER_01, No.,553.223,553.486
SPEAKER_01,There's no need to do that.,554.233,554.92
SPEAKER_00, No need to do that?,555.94,556.451
SPEAKER_01, No.,557.0,557.061
SPEAKER_01,You wash your hands 30 seconds.,557.081,559.493
SPEAKER_01,That's it.,559.714,560.015
SPEAKER_01,That's all you need to do.,560.257,560.86
SPEAKER_00, Do you have any particular concerns about germs or anything like that?,562.262,565.237
SPEAKER_01," I try to keep meat, but not particularly, no.",567.744,570.88
SPEAKER_00," Have you ever found yourself in a situation where touching something repeatedly like a doorknob or operating a light switch seems to lower your anxiety, like repeatedly doing that?",572.781,583.88
SPEAKER_01, Not at all.,585.324,585.869
SPEAKER_01,That seems like a waste of time.,586.193,586.9
SPEAKER_00, That would be inefficient?,588.226,588.92
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,590.587,590.991
SPEAKER_01,There's no need to do that.,591.011,591.92
SPEAKER_00," How about double checking, for example, light switches to make sure the doors are locked?",593.0,597.92
SPEAKER_01, I make sure my doors are locked the first time.,597.92,599.92
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,601.546,601.768
SPEAKER_00,"So you check, but just the one time?",601.789,602.92
SPEAKER_01," Well, I do it when I come in the door.",603.92,605.375
SPEAKER_01,Lock the door.,605.395,605.718
SPEAKER_01,That's it.,605.738,605.92
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,607.634,607.859
SPEAKER_00, So what do you think the solution here is?,610.983,614.01
SPEAKER_00,Your employer sends you in for counseling.,614.471,616.296
SPEAKER_00,What would you like to change?,616.336,616.978
SPEAKER_01, He wants me to be more flexible.,619.502,620.765
SPEAKER_01,To not get as upset if there is an unscheduled meeting.,621.026,624.195
SPEAKER_01,If somebody wants to switch shifts with me.,624.376,625.9
SPEAKER_01," I don't really understand it, but I'm in trouble at work, so I have to look into it.",627.963,632.9
SPEAKER_00, You like your job?,634.206,634.798
SPEAKER_01, I do like my job.,635.94,636.862

SPEAKER_01,"If somebody calls for something, oh, it's right here.",643.154,644.317
SPEAKER_01,I love it.,644.357,644.838
SPEAKER_01,It's like a machine.,645.098,645.84
SPEAKER_00, So you like your job.,648.442,649.704
SPEAKER_00,You like how you're able to be organized there.,649.905,652.949
SPEAKER_00,But there's some conflict with coworkers and your boss.,654.472,658.157
SPEAKER_00,You want to try to work that out.,658.217,659.9
SPEAKER_01, I guess.,661.06,661.562
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, I don't want to lose my job.",662.204,663.89
SPEAKER_01,"And if this is a problem, the right thing to do would be to come speak to you.",663.95,666.699
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so you're open to attending counseling sessions and taking a look at what's going on here?",669.084,673.92
SPEAKER_01, Absolutely.,676.267,676.748
SPEAKER_01,"If my boss requires it, if my boss requires it, then that's the right thing to do.",676.768,680.92

SPEAKER_00,We'll get you on the schedule to see a counselor here.,690.914,693.498
SPEAKER_00,It might take about a week.,693.518,694.359
SPEAKER_00,And we'll go from there.,694.379,694.9
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,696.082,696.304
SPEAKER_00,So in a week.,696.344,696.647
SPEAKER_01,"Alright, thank you.",697.092,697.859
SPEAKER_01, Thanks.,699.369,699.573
