SPEAKER_00," Hi Kyle, how are you doing today?",0.941,15.698
SPEAKER_00, I'm doing okay I guess.,17.2,18.225
SPEAKER_00, I guess something happened over this past week.,21.7,24.596
SPEAKER_00, I've been looking for a new job since I left my last one and I found this really good job  on the internet.,26.262,34.61
SPEAKER_00, But the problem is that the job is working with kids and they have to do a drug test  in order for me to get the job.,35.72,43.288
SPEAKER_00, And it kind of like made me think a little bit more about something that I've been considering  for a while which is kind of just giving up weed for good.,45.18,55.932
SPEAKER_00, Like I've been thinking about it for a while but I also kind of think about the way weed  really helps me.,59.48,69.227
SPEAKER_00," If I'm ever feeling really really anxious about something, I mean weed kind of helps  me chill out and helps me relax and I just don't know if I'm ready to give that up yet.",70.48,80.635
SPEAKER_01, So the marijuana has a real value for you that you don't want to see going.,82.1,86.159
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, yeah it does.",86.441,87.459
SPEAKER_00, It's like a way to self-medicate in a way.,87.802,89.633
SPEAKER_01, And at the same time you would like this job.,91.422,94.432
SPEAKER_01, So I could see how this would be in a pinch here.,96.8,99.736
SPEAKER_00," Right, yeah it's kind of like it's put me in a difficult spot.",100.56,105.119
SPEAKER_00, Like I definitely want to get that job but you know if I cut out smoking like I don't  know what else I would do.,105.36,113.857
SPEAKER_00, Like if I started to have a panic attack or if I was really like anxious about like anything  that I'm worrying about.,114.0,121.679
SPEAKER_00, Like I don't know what I'd do to cope.,121.821,123.514
SPEAKER_01, Have you ever been treated for anxiety before?,124.782,126.851
SPEAKER_00," I did therapy for a little bit but it was like, I don't know.",129.261,133.96
SPEAKER_00, Back then it was kind of like when the anxiety was just starting so it wasn't too big of  a problem.,134.08,140.193
SPEAKER_00, So I like I quit therapy because it wasn't really doing that much.,140.58,142.972
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,145.109,145.292
SPEAKER_01, Do you take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety?,146.903,152.457
SPEAKER_00, I mean like if I'm bored or maybe if I'm like hanging out with buddies like I don't really  have a reason not to do it like until now.,153.96,162.935
SPEAKER_00, But it wasn't like like I really use it whenever I'm like feeling really anxious about something.,164.04,171.156
SPEAKER_01, So and you may not be able to answer this question but if you didn't have any anxiety  would that change your motivation to use marijuana?,173.381,184.997
SPEAKER_00, If I didn't have like any kind of anxiety.,186.04,188.028
SPEAKER_00, Like it would still be kind of tough to give it up because like if I'm hanging out with  my buddies and they offer it to me like that's always pretty chill.,191.0,197.379
SPEAKER_00, But I don't like I really I'm really looking forward to this job and like the benefits  of having that job would outweigh the benefits of just like smoking my buddies.,197.62,207.596
SPEAKER_00, So you're excited about the job?,208.761,210.538
SPEAKER_00, I am.,210.902,211.167
SPEAKER_00, Yeah it's almost kind of a dream job.,211.901,213.456
SPEAKER_00, Well tell me about it.,214.922,215.529
SPEAKER_00, Well it's working with it's working with kids with autism in the school so like I would  be kind of like a almost like a personal TA in a way.,216.44,226.299
SPEAKER_00, So like it's a part of an inclusion program so when the kids are going into the class  like I would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like  help them out in case something comes up.,226.56,239.25
SPEAKER_00, And it's like since my brother has autism that's like it's that's something that I've  always really kind of wanted to work with.,241.02,246.508
SPEAKER_01, So it sounds like you have real passion for this type of work.,248.54,251.231
SPEAKER_01, And really the big obstacle here is this marijuana.,253.32,256.175
SPEAKER_00, It is it's like a catch-22 too because it's like I know the job will be great but it's  like it's a it's a big step for me to take that job.,257.14,265.275
SPEAKER_00, And it's going to be super it's going to make me super anxious.,266.42,270.096
SPEAKER_00, You know it's going to be like it's going to be a lot of anxiety taking a new job so  it's like if I have to give up the marijuana and then like not have another way to cope  with anxiety like to get the job it's like a catch-22.,270.9,283.411
SPEAKER_01, Yeah it's a predicament.,286.08,287.308
SPEAKER_01, You're kind of weighing both sides of this right.,289.36,291.755
SPEAKER_01, Now I'm wondering do you have do you think you have like a physical craving for the marijuana?,292.5,299.258
SPEAKER_01, No I mean not really.,300.261,301.871
SPEAKER_01, So you're really using it recreationally and as an anti-anxiety agent.,303.46,307.939
SPEAKER_01, Yeah yeah pretty much.,308.582,309.227
SPEAKER_01, So if you were I know you didn't have great success before in therapy to combat anxiety  but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job which it seems like you  would really like.,311.14,322.583
SPEAKER_01, You think you'd be able to stay away from marijuana?,325.86,328.43
SPEAKER_00, I think if the therapy really worked I would be able to.,330.84,335.435
SPEAKER_00, Like it's just so easy now just to kind of light up like that's an easy fix and like  I don't think therapy is going to be that instant so like it would it would be tough.,336.82,352.755
SPEAKER_00, I think if I had real confidence that the therapy would work I could do it but I mean  it would have to it would definitely have to work like just as well as smoking.,355.641,364.277
SPEAKER_01, You would need to see results.,365.2,366.114
SPEAKER_00, Yeah yeah definitely.,366.842,367.445
SPEAKER_01, Would having the job that you're passionate about reduce your anxiety?,370.26,375.093
SPEAKER_00, After a while like after I got used to the job but like just starting the new job would  make me kind of anxious and then like it would be tough not to not to smoke while doing that.,377.5,390.06
SPEAKER_00, Like I don't I don't even get why they drug test anymore because like it's it's being  decriminalized it's being legalized in so many places and there's so much research saying  that it's not that bad that it's kind of like it's really upsetting that the place that  I really want to work has that policy.,390.18,408.04
SPEAKER_00, I think it's really silly.,408.444,409.294
SPEAKER_00, You're frustrated marijuana is illegal.,409.82,411.316
SPEAKER_00, Yeah it's yeah.,411.74,412.807
SPEAKER_01, At the same time it's the reality you're living in.,414.7,417.073
SPEAKER_00, Right yeah it's I think it will be legalized in like in the state in a couple years but  until then like I mean I can't wait that long to start start working so.,418.48,428.617
SPEAKER_01, Until then you still need to address this dilemma.,429.5,431.513
SPEAKER_01, Right yeah it's still a problem.,432.7,434.274
SPEAKER_01, So you have choices here right?,435.02,436.092
SPEAKER_01, You can continue to use marijuana and not take the job.,436.86,440.052
SPEAKER_01, And that seems like something that has some advantages for you but some some disadvantages.,442.3,446.618
SPEAKER_01, Right.,447.06,447.244
SPEAKER_01, Because you would really like that job.,448.544,450.096
SPEAKER_00, Yeah and I would it's it sounds so pathetic to be like no I don't want to take my dream  job because I need weed like sounds really stupid.,450.62,458.372
SPEAKER_01, So where do you think you are in terms of making this change?,460.46,463.355
SPEAKER_01, Do you feel motivated to take some steps toward it?,465.686,468.798
SPEAKER_00, I don't like I'm I'm still kind of on the fence because like if I if I have to give  it up for the job I could do that but I would definitely need like some other way to get  rid of all this anxiety.,470.583,484.79
SPEAKER_00, Like whether it's therapy or whether it's like something else I yeah I would I would  definitely need like a substitute if I got rid of it for good.,485.82,494.419
SPEAKER_01, So you definitely you're saying you definitely need it.,494.922,496.555
SPEAKER_01, So you can't give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative  that would help with that anxiety.,497.22,505.335
SPEAKER_01, Right.,505.66,506.17
SPEAKER_01, That's the key to you to make this change.,506.66,508.33
SPEAKER_01, Yeah yeah definitely.,509.86,511.994
SPEAKER_01, But at the same time that would be ideal because then you could take the job.,512.94,515.331
SPEAKER_00, Right yeah I mean I mean if I really thought that I could like get some kind of treatment  that was as good as weed yeah I mean I could I could maybe quit especially if it helps,517.22,529.08
SPEAKER_01, to get this job especially.,529.12,530.61
SPEAKER_01, So with anxiety reduction your chances of stopping marijuana increase and then you could  take the job that you want.,532.26,539.668
SPEAKER_00, Yeah yeah I mean that would be the best best outcome.,540.86,543.375
SPEAKER_01, Is that the outcome you would most want?,544.26,545.548
SPEAKER_00, Yeah I think so.,547.46,548.338
SPEAKER_00, I think I could give up record like dealing with my buddies recreationally.,548.56,552.759
SPEAKER_00, I could yeah I'm just light up a cigarette.,553.18,554.79
SPEAKER_01, So here's what I'm thinking and let me know what you think about this.,556.46,560.696
SPEAKER_01, When you come back next week right what if we start looking at this anxiety?,561.7,566.298
SPEAKER_01, What if we start you know I start treating this anxiety?,567.362,571.018
SPEAKER_01, All right and we see if we can get it reduced and kind of work from there because maybe  when you start to feel if that works and that anxiety starts to abate it sounds like it  would just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage.,572.161,588.255
SPEAKER_01, Yeah yeah it would be.,589.08,590.775
SPEAKER_01, What kind of time frame are you going to want in terms of taking this job?,591.38,595.879
SPEAKER_00, I mean the job it has a high turnover rate so like even if I like I need to apply this  week but if I don't get in more than likely another position like it will open up like  within a month or two.,596.32,609.745
SPEAKER_00, And when would they drug test you?,612.42,614.411
SPEAKER_00, It would be like right after I apply.,616.02,620.259
SPEAKER_00, So if I applied and then did the interview that's when they would give him the paperwork  and I'd have to go get drug tested.,620.54,625.073
SPEAKER_00, When's the last time you used marijuana?,626.002,627.232
SPEAKER_00, Just a couple days ago.,628.14,628.793
SPEAKER_01, So you see what I'm getting at?,630.51,631.417
SPEAKER_00, Yeah yeah it's a yeah so I like I wouldn't be able to do I wouldn't be able to make it  this application but I mean I would like to be off it by the next one.,632.121,641.613
SPEAKER_01, So you're fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high.,643.481,646.398
SPEAKER_01, Right.,646.781,647.352
SPEAKER_01, So that's an opportunity to apply later on.,648.04,649.59
SPEAKER_01, So do you feel like you could invest in that plan?,651.26,653.277
SPEAKER_01, Let's work on the anxiety see what happens with the marijuana see if we can reduce your  usage of it or have you stop that altogether and then kind of move toward this job?,653.62,664.776
SPEAKER_01, Yeah yeah I could deal with that.,665.74,666.871
SPEAKER_01, Alright so how about next time you come in we'll start talking about the anxiety and  let's see what we can do about that and we'll kind of move from there.,668.242,676.798
SPEAKER_01, Alright yeah sounds good.,677.581,678.52
SPEAKER_01, Sounds good?,678.846,679.173
SPEAKER_01, Mm hmm.,679.846,680.03
SPEAKER_01, Alright thanks Kyle.,680.581,681.499
, Thank you.,681.54,681.957
