SPEAKER_01," Well, hi Miss Clark.",1.124,1.827
SPEAKER_01,My name is Alan Lime.,2.088,2.912
SPEAKER_01,I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center.,2.972,4.618
SPEAKER_01, Dr. Seal asked me if I would spend some time with you today.,5.602,8.233
SPEAKER_01,I'm really glad that you're here.,8.253,9.598
SPEAKER_01, I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me.,10.0,11.535
SPEAKER_00," Well, I came to see Dr. Seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety  that's kind of getting the best of me.",12.602,18.466
SPEAKER_00,"In the course of my appointment with him,  he was asking how I was dealing with that stress.",19.249,24.308
SPEAKER_00,And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine  a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights.,24.428,33.478
SPEAKER_00, And he had some concerns about that and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something.,34.0,43.519
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, so he asked you to see me because you went to him for increased stress  and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase.",44.261,53.658
SPEAKER_01," Prior to prescribing you anything, you wanted to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to about that.",54.402,58.0
SPEAKER_01, I suppose.,58.0,58.469
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,59.564,59.805
SPEAKER_01,I saw that you filled in one of the pink sheets.,60.228,61.477
SPEAKER_01,Can I take a look at that?,61.497,62.0
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, he told me to fill that out and bring it with me.",62.04,63.899
SPEAKER_01," Okay, thank you.",64.1,65.143
SPEAKER_01,So you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week.,66.206,71.0
SPEAKER_01, You mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well.,72.206,74.94
SPEAKER_01, And that you have one or two drinks in one setting.,75.081,78.0
SPEAKER_01, Typically.,78.02,78.265
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, and maybe monthly you have more than that.",79.341,83.011
SPEAKER_00,What kind of drinks do you have?,83.032,84.054
SPEAKER_01, What do you drink when you typically drink?,86.586,87.879
SPEAKER_00, Wine with my meals.,88.08,89.803
SPEAKER_00,"Again, one or two typically and more frequently three or four since my stress has increased.",91.165,101.94
SPEAKER_01," So it's starting to increase, you're starting to drink a little more.",102.322,104.174
SPEAKER_01," Based on what you put here, it gives you six points on this scale.",105.602,108.793
SPEAKER_01,The scale ranges from zero to forty.,109.395,110.98
SPEAKER_01, So six points will put you in what we would consider an at-risk zone.,111.724,114.839
SPEAKER_01," So if it's okay with you, I'll just talk a little bit about that.",116.668,118.879
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,119.224,119.49
SPEAKER_01," So the at-risk zone, say it runs zero to forty, it's not a super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress,  maybe some physical ailments related to alcohol as well.",121.003,131.0
SPEAKER_01, Could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or even stay there.,131.883,136.478
SPEAKER_01, This is a typical standard drink size over here.,137.321,139.708
SPEAKER_01,I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine or not.,139.728,143.499
SPEAKER_00," I filled a glass up, so maybe a little more than that.",144.0,146.617
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, maybe a little space at the top.",147.0,148.305
SPEAKER_01,So perhaps a drink and a half each one.,148.325,149.691
SPEAKER_01,So that also increases a little bit more.,150.012,151.518
SPEAKER_01, So perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here.,152.0,154.658
SPEAKER_01," And for a healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no risk and no more than seven in one week.",155.361,163.88
SPEAKER_00, Seven total in one week?,164.184,164.98
SPEAKER_01, Seven total in one week.,165.04,165.983
SPEAKER_01,"And what you say here is that even on this sheet, you are perhaps already drinking more than that.",166.043,170.498
SPEAKER_01, So what do you make of all that?,171.707,172.616
SPEAKER_00, That's news to me.,173.541,176.106
SPEAKER_00,"I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and no more than seven in a week, that seems kind of prohibitive.",176.126,183.98
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking.",184.0,189.639
SPEAKER_01, And certainly there's conflicting information out there about what's healthy and what's not healthy.,190.261,194.618
SPEAKER_01, I imagine the increased stress is what concerns Dr. Seal as your stress increases.,195.582,201.378
SPEAKER_01," And if he were to prescribe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two that would also be a concern for him, I would think.",202.02,208.438
SPEAKER_01," So if you would, what is it that you like about alcohol?",209.624,211.94
SPEAKER_00," Well, you know, it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress.",212.723,216.96
SPEAKER_00," And I, you know, like a good glass of wine.",217.461,220.871
SPEAKER_00,I don't drink the cheap stuff.,220.911,222.516
SPEAKER_00,I like the expensive.,222.616,223.88
SPEAKER_01, So you like the taste of it and it does help to lower the stress significantly for that time you're drinking.,224.622,228.98
SPEAKER_01, What are the lots of good things about alcohol for you?,229.0,231.899
SPEAKER_00," Well, you know, the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should, I wake up feeling kind of yuck.",234.446,240.0
SPEAKER_00," And of course, part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff.",240.261,245.96
SPEAKER_00, And so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden.,246.924,251.0
SPEAKER_01, So your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking.,252.084,255.92
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, kind of defeating the purpose there.",256.302,260.0
SPEAKER_01," On the catch-22, they're drinking to do stress and increasing stress at the same time.",260.06,263.0
SPEAKER_01," So on the one hand it lowers it and on the other hand it's increasing, kind of the see-saw, tita-tare effect there.",263.12,269.0
SPEAKER_01," What do you make of that, given that on one hand it lowers and the other hand it increases and now it's increasing even more?",271.384,276.619
SPEAKER_00, Maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress.,277.563,279.995
SPEAKER_01, I imagine you've had some thoughts with that.,282.787,284.233
SPEAKER_01,"What have you thought of trying, if anything?",284.273,285.92
SPEAKER_00," Well, I've exercised in the past and that helps.",286.502,289.672
SPEAKER_00,Right now my schedule is kind of out of whack.,290.194,292.0
SPEAKER_00, And I just really don't know what to do.,292.361,295.775
SPEAKER_00,That's why I came to see Dr. Seal.,295.815,296.98
SPEAKER_00, I thought maybe he could prescribe me something that would help me when I'm feeling overwhelmed.,297.12,301.96
SPEAKER_01, And he may be able to.,302.483,303.309
SPEAKER_01,I'm not saying that he cannot.,303.389,304.376
SPEAKER_01," I'm just imagining that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking,  that whatever he prescribes you, there may be an interaction with the two.",305.0,313.216
SPEAKER_01, I imagine that's his concern.,314.261,315.628
SPEAKER_01,I'm not completely sure.,316.432,317.377
SPEAKER_01, So you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors.,318.04,320.819
SPEAKER_01," And if you were to decide to make any changes here, it sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes.",321.502,326.619
SPEAKER_01, How important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10?,327.482,330.153
SPEAKER_01,I have a little visual here of that.,330.213,332.0
SPEAKER_01," If 0 is not important and 10 is very important, to do something about your drinking right now.",332.964,336.94
SPEAKER_00," Well, I mean, if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking,  then it's fairly important, maybe about a 7.",338.042,350.195
SPEAKER_01, That's pretty up there.,351.642,353.308
SPEAKER_01,"Why did you choose a 7, not a 5 or a 4?",353.609,354.953
SPEAKER_00," Well, again, I've got to get things under control.",357.322,359.638
SPEAKER_00, My kids are dependent on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress.,360.04,367.719
SPEAKER_00, And so all those responsibilities make it...,368.543,371.98
SPEAKER_01, So there's a lot riding on your decision here on what to do with this.,372.02,374.819
SPEAKER_01," What, if anything, would bring it up to an 8 or 9 on that scale?",375.383,377.758
SPEAKER_00," Well, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can't afford to have any more stress.",381.22,391.98
SPEAKER_01, So you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it.,395.141,397.98
SPEAKER_01," And if lowering your drinking would have that effect, that's something you'd be willing to do right now.",398.522,402.719
SPEAKER_01, How confident are you that you could do something about your drinking?,403.564,405.98
SPEAKER_00," Pretty confident, probably about a 7 or an 8.",408.463,410.98
SPEAKER_01," Okay, so it's pretty high up there again.",411.242,413.0
SPEAKER_01," And what, if anything, would you choose to do?",413.626,414.98
SPEAKER_01, Would it be to cut down?,415.04,416.611
SPEAKER_01,Would it be to quit?,416.631,417.235
SPEAKER_01,I'm just curious about what you're...,417.255,418.0
SPEAKER_00," Well, like I said, I like a good glass of wine.",418.101,420.894
SPEAKER_00,I don't want to quit altogether.,420.915,421.96
SPEAKER_00, I'd be willing to try cutting that.,422.242,424.839
SPEAKER_00," But now if Dr. Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety,  and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time.",425.241,436.0
SPEAKER_01, So you'd be willing to stop altogether.,436.261,438.513
SPEAKER_01,That's what was indicated by the physician.,438.573,439.96
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,440.1,441.885
SPEAKER_01,"So based on that, how ready are you to do anything right now, whether it's to cut back, whether it's to quit?",442.266,447.98
SPEAKER_00," Well, again, if I can get something to help me manage, if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress,  then I'd be pretty ready.",449.043,459.471
SPEAKER_00,"Again, maybe about on that scale, maybe an 8.",460.454,462.619
SPEAKER_01," Okay, so that's pretty high up there as well.",463.161,465.195
SPEAKER_01," It sounds as though you're pretty motivated to do something about this right now,  given your responsibilities, given your children, relying at this point.",466.523,473.337
SPEAKER_01," And just on lowering your anxiety in general, it sounds that that's one of your goals as well.",474.321,478.157
SPEAKER_01," Well, I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do,  you'll be able to follow through with that based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes,  I imagine there's some things there you can draw upon.",479.161,489.953
SPEAKER_01," What's one thing that you could do, I imagine you thought of some things, that might help to lower your stress?",491.261,495.936
SPEAKER_00," Well, the exercise, but again, that's kind of difficult to fit in right now.",497.862,502.195
SPEAKER_00," Hoping that Dr. Seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed  and maybe just having somebody to talk to, to bounce some things off of.",504.301,514.98
SPEAKER_01, One of the things we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists.,515.904,520.0
SPEAKER_01," We may be able to help you talk through this area of your life, this area of increased stress,  and some responsibility there.",520.08,526.596
SPEAKER_01," And we can make an appointment for you if you like, before you leave today, to talk to somebody.",527.925,530.98
SPEAKER_01, That'd be nice.,531.184,531.612
SPEAKER_00, Great.,532.361,532.581
SPEAKER_01,"I also have some information here if you're interested, a pamphlet on alcohol and what healthy limits are  and how it may be affected by medications that you take as well.",532.982,543.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,543.143,543.286
SPEAKER_01, And I wish you lots of luck.,545.124,546.51
SPEAKER_01,It sounds as though you're really committed to making this shift and this change.,546.53,549.0
SPEAKER_01, And I imagine Dr. Seal will want to follow up with you and see how you do with your change within a few weeks.,550.223,555.92
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,556.082,556.163
SPEAKER_01," And again, I look forward to speaking to you in the future.",557.282,560.0
SPEAKER_01, All right.,560.02,560.245
SPEAKER_01,Thank you very much.,560.265,561.0
SPEAKER_00, You're very welcome.,561.061,561.959
