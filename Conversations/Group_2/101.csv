SPEAKER_00," Hi, this is Dr. Grande.",7.197,8.219
SPEAKER_00, I hope you find this video useful.,8.661,10.234
SPEAKER_00," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel.",10.96,13.936
SPEAKER_00," As always, thanks for watching.",14.74,16.127
," Hello, Frank.",18.68,18.902
SPEAKER_00," Hello, Sarah.",23.658,23.9
SPEAKER_00, How are you doing today?,24.061,25.511
SPEAKER_01, Doing well.,26.72,27.026
SPEAKER_01, Doing well?,28.189,28.536
SPEAKER_01, I understand that you've come in because you're having a little difficulty in your relationship.,28.72,33.08
SPEAKER_01, Can you tell me about that?,34.007,34.772
SPEAKER_01," So basically, it's been getting a little bit worse since we got married.",35.92,41.8
SPEAKER_01, We got married about a year and a half ago.,41.941,43.567
SPEAKER_01," The woman that I married, I thought we were both kind of independent people and I thought  that we would kind of go our separate ways, do our own thing.",46.9,53.759
SPEAKER_01," We used to in college, but it's kind of gotten to the point now where it's like, I just want  to have all my own personal space and I kind of want to be left alone sometimes.",54.382,61.333
SPEAKER_01," All right, so you're looking for independence in your relationship.",64.044,68.718
SPEAKER_01, How long have you been together?,69.28,70.26
SPEAKER_01, About a year.,70.953,71.26
SPEAKER_01," I mean, we just got married a year and a half ago, but we've been dating for about four  or five years.",71.34,79.154
SPEAKER_01," Okay, so total of four or five years married for a year and a half.",79.701,82.954
SPEAKER_01," Frank, when did you notice what you kind of think of as the problem, like the lack  of independence?",85.524,90.171
SPEAKER_01, I guess kind of once we got married.,91.364,92.854
SPEAKER_01," After that, it seemed like we were spending all of our time together, which at first was  great because we're newlyweds.",93.88,100.156
SPEAKER_01," We love spending time together and everything, but I guess probably about six months to a  year after we first got married, it's kind of progressed to the point where now it's  just kind of becoming like a burden that whatever I do, she's always there with me.",100.68,116.077
SPEAKER_01, We're always spending every waking moment together and sometimes it's just nice to have  my own personal space and freedom.,116.8,122.452
SPEAKER_01, You're looking for that freedom.,124.16,125.189
SPEAKER_01," Sarah, does this kind of resonate with you, what Frank is saying?",126.52,129.477
SPEAKER_01," I just feel like, I mean, we're newlyweds and I just want to spend time with him and  I feel like he doesn't want that and he wants to be with his friends, doesn't want me around.",130.2,142.157
SPEAKER_01," I just sometimes don't feel wanted and he's so angry at me, I can tell.",143.54,150.053
SPEAKER_01," Can you tell him that, you just told me?",153.8,155.675
SPEAKER_01, I just feel like I want to feel wanted and I don't feel that way.,156.48,161.96
SPEAKER_01, I just feel like you're so angry with me and the truth is that I just want to spend  time with you and just do everything with you.,161.96,173.191
SPEAKER_01," So Frank, what's it like to hear that?",176.22,177.367
SPEAKER_01," It kind of reminds me of how I used to be, you know, like she said, we've been dating  for four or five years and back then it wasn't a problem.",179.68,187.917
SPEAKER_01," She could go out and do her own thing, I could go out and do my own thing and didn't have  to worry about each other but now that we're spending every moment together, you know,  it's just, I'm always worried about her, she's always worried about me and when I do get  the chance to go hang out with some friends or something like that, it always feels like,  you know, I have pressure on me because I should be with her or she should be there  with me, you know, and I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing by trying to be independent,  try to go do things by myself.",188.6,217.612
SPEAKER_01, You feel guilty.,218.62,219.049
SPEAKER_01, I do.,219.6,219.784
SPEAKER_01," So, Sarah, do you sense that in Frank, that he feels guilty about that?",222.085,225.797
SPEAKER_01," No, I just feel like he's pushing me away.",227.684,231.097
SPEAKER_01, You feel rejected.,231.821,232.891
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,233.881,234.103
SPEAKER_01," And this has happened, the same experience for both of you, like your feeling of rejection  and your feeling of wanting freedom, this has happened right from the beginning of the  marriage or a little bit after?",235.76,246.418
SPEAKER_01," It was a little bit after, so like I said, probably like the first six months to a year,  it was really good but then, you know, recently it's kind of been a burden, you know, just  always spending time together and trying to make amends and trying not to get into fights  because we're always spending so much time together.",247.102,264.297
SPEAKER_01," All right, so you mentioned that the six months to a year, has it been the same for you?",265.624,268.979
SPEAKER_01, Like was the beginning of the marriage something different than what you have now?,269.662,273.337
SPEAKER_01," I think that it was just, you know, we're still in the, you know, after the wedding  and honeymoon and everything's great and a couple months after and then that's when it  started later on, so.",274.52,285.357
SPEAKER_01," All right, so for you a couple months after that initial phase?",286.865,289.799
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,290.08,290.243
SPEAKER_01, All right.,291.223,292.08
SPEAKER_01, So around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriage?,292.08,296.339
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,296.925,297.558
, Yeah.,297.762,298.047
SPEAKER_01," So, let me try to sum it up and correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like you've been  doing it for a long time.",299.182,305.26
SPEAKER_01, It sounds like you want more space.,305.321,306.28
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I do.",306.28,306.586
SPEAKER_01," Frank and Sarah, you feel like this desire to have space is really kind of like a rejection  or pushing you away.",307.36,315.249
SPEAKER_01, I just feel like he wants space all the time.,317.223,321.297
SPEAKER_01," Okay, are you okay with some space?",322.883,324.632
SPEAKER_01," Um, I think so.",328.505,333.559
SPEAKER_01," Maybe I could, maybe it's something we could try and work on next time.",336.907,342.519
SPEAKER_01, You don't seem real certain.,343.846,344.994
SPEAKER_01, I don't know.,348.316,348.86
SPEAKER_01, I just maybe kind of get anxiety a little bit when he's gone.,349.5,354.595
SPEAKER_01, I feel like I need to be with him.,357.143,360.014
SPEAKER_01, So maybe this idea of space isn't really something you feel will work for you.,362.202,367.337
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I want to try to make our marriage work.",370.466,373.314
SPEAKER_01," I don't know, honestly.",377.99,379.477
SPEAKER_01," If I can say that I do think it'll work, I want to try.",380.983,385.438
SPEAKER_01, So you want to try to address Frank's concerns about this space?,386.842,392.799
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,393.774,393.958
SPEAKER_01, But you seem apprehensive about it.,395.204,398.414
SPEAKER_01," Um, I'm not really sure how it's going to play out, but maybe something we could try.",400.68,411.159
SPEAKER_01," Like if he wants to go out with your friends some night, maybe next week, and then see  how it makes me feel.",411.68,425.59
SPEAKER_01, I know it's maybe something I can work on.,428.32,429.71
SPEAKER_01, So maybe just experiment with it.,431.28,432.775
SPEAKER_01, Try it for one night and see what happens.,433.32,436.099
SPEAKER_01," So in the year and a half you've been married, has there ever been a night when you've gone  out by yourself?",436.28,440.785
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, there's been a couple, especially earlier on, which is nice.",442.28,446.099
SPEAKER_01, Just getting to see old friends and our old college friends.,446.481,450.557
SPEAKER_01," Of course we attended events together, seeing old friends and everything like that.",451.862,455.738
SPEAKER_01," There's been a few times, not more than I can count on both my hands, but there's been  a few times where I've gone out and just had a guy's night or something.",457.201,465.595
SPEAKER_01, And what happened in terms of between you?,467.101,469.835
SPEAKER_01," So, just getting out of the house is basically the hardest part.",471.923,475.816
SPEAKER_01," Just finding a way to ensure her that it'll be okay, I'm going to be back home later on  that she doesn't need to worry about me.",477.261,485.914
SPEAKER_01," If I have any trouble or anything pops up that I need her help, I'll let her know.",486.761,490.617
SPEAKER_01," Just knowing that I love her and telling her that I love her, making sure that she knows  that I'll be back.",491.801,498.268
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes it's hard because she just gets upset when I tell her that I'm leaving and  she doesn't want me to go and she would rather me stay or even take her with me.,499.56,508.139
SPEAKER_01, I don't want to be the only guy that shows up with my wife.,509.225,511.48
SPEAKER_01," Everybody else left their wives at home also, so I don't want to be the odd man out.",512.08,516.176
SPEAKER_01," Alright, so this is really an experiment that's already been tried.",518.405,521.498
SPEAKER_01, Tried once or twice.,522.888,523.898
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, just a few times.",524.464,525.797
SPEAKER_01, Is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week it'll be different?,527.164,530.437
SPEAKER_01, I guess not.,534.383,534.969
SPEAKER_01, You don't think so Frank?,536.141,536.969
SPEAKER_01," Maybe not, maybe.",538.221,539.959
SPEAKER_01," We've been doing it the past couple months, but it seems like every time we do it, it's  the same result.",540.861,547.074
SPEAKER_01," Her getting worried about me and me trying to find a way to assure her that it's going  to be okay and that we're still married, we're still in love, or anything like that.",547.961,559.677
SPEAKER_01, I really want my space and it seems like sometimes I just can't get out of her grip.,561.744,566.419
SPEAKER_01," Sarah, what do you think about that?",569.813,570.818
SPEAKER_01, I just feel like lately on the weekends he wants to be with his friends more.,572.022,577.197
SPEAKER_01," That's when I want to go out to movies or do something with him, like go on a date.",578.982,586.879
SPEAKER_01," The weekend's over, he has to go to work.",588.183,593.558
SPEAKER_01," In terms of going out alone, or going out with your friends, would it have to be on  the weekend?",597.667,603.163
SPEAKER_01, Something could happen during the week?,604.92,606.698
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, absolutely.",606.9,607.627
SPEAKER_01, A lot of my friends normally go out during the week because they have their families  and everything to take care of on the weekend.,608.88,614.254
SPEAKER_01, I could definitely go out tonight during the week.,615.403,617.654
SPEAKER_01, The both of you could agree to that as terms of this behavioral experiment where on the  weekends you'll spend those weekends together.,620.803,630.775
SPEAKER_01, I think we could try that.,632.445,634.153
SPEAKER_01, That was a concern you specifically brought up.,636.023,639.018
SPEAKER_01," Sarah, how about the times during the week, how do you feel about those?",641.004,643.271
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, we could try to switch it up.",647.282,648.999
SPEAKER_01," We could try to go out during the week as opposed to the weekends, or we could try to  go out with his friends during the week as opposed to the weekends.",649.341,656.99
SPEAKER_01, You feel like you'd respond better to that?,660.141,661.656
SPEAKER_01, Would that be a better experience?,662.1,664.214
SPEAKER_01, I feel like there'd be more of a balance.,665.08,666.691
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I do.",670.931,671.313
SPEAKER_01, Something that you'd think that you could try next week?,673.68,677.29
SPEAKER_01," Let's talk about when, because you've gone out before and you said it was just getting  out of the house.",680.72,687.68
SPEAKER_01, That was the real challenge.,687.821,689.512
SPEAKER_01," Walk me through, this really goes to both of you, walk me through what happens when  you're getting ready to leave, when you're planning to head out.",691.101,699.531
SPEAKER_01," Usually I'll get dressed, I'll let her know where I'm going, give her my cell phone number,  somebody else's phone number in case my phone is off.",702.28,710.111
SPEAKER_01," Basically tell her what we're going to do, whether we're going out to a bar or going  to watch some sporting event or something like that.",712.4,719.938
SPEAKER_01, I would tell her what we're doing just so she knows and knows where she can find me.,720.4,724.775
SPEAKER_01," After that, it seems like as soon as I assure her of what we're doing and when it's happening,  when I'll be home, everything like that, it just seems like all the progress I made towards  the front door kind of gets pulled back a little bit because she doesn't want me to  leave.",726.4,741.023
SPEAKER_01, I can see in her eyes that she's not very happy about me leaving her.,741.9,745.274
SPEAKER_01, That kind of makes me feel guilty because I don't want to leave her all alone.,746.88,750.936
SPEAKER_01, I want her to be more independent.,751.88,753.819
SPEAKER_01," I kind of want her to, if I'm going out, I would like her to go out as well.",753.88,756.795
SPEAKER_01, She still has tons of friends.,757.941,759.456
SPEAKER_01," We both have friends, we both have our social circles.",760.48,762.493
SPEAKER_01, It's frustrating when I can't go do my thing because she's always got to be with me.,763.48,769.878
SPEAKER_01," Ultimately, after all that, you do go, but you feel guilty.",771.343,774.918
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,775.521,775.745
SPEAKER_01, Do you have a good time?,777.165,777.889
SPEAKER_01, Most of the time I do.,779.48,780.227
SPEAKER_01," Sometimes, I just can't get over the fact that I have my wife at home who's upset at  me.",781.902,786.562
SPEAKER_01, That makes me upset.,787.684,788.48
SPEAKER_01, It's just a matter of finding the balance between my independence and her doing her  own thing because I would like her to do that as well.,789.08,799.557
SPEAKER_01, All right.,800.856,801.08
SPEAKER_01," Sometimes, you have a good time.",801.363,803.08
SPEAKER_01," Sometimes, you don't.",803.549,804.08
SPEAKER_01, You're worried about Sarah being home.,804.986,807.06
SPEAKER_01, How about when you come home?,807.1,808.676
SPEAKER_01," When I come home, usually things go back to normal.",810.366,813.08
SPEAKER_01, We've definitely had our exchange of words after a few times of me coming back.,814.001,818.68
SPEAKER_01," Most of the time, it goes back to normal, which is fine.",818.68,822.455
SPEAKER_01," We're a very loving, affectionate couple.",824.564,827.238
SPEAKER_01," That's awesome, but most of the time, it's just overbearing.",828.142,833.138
SPEAKER_01," Is that how you see it, Sarah, the way Frank described it?",835.107,837.559
SPEAKER_01," I just feel like things do go back to normal, but inside, I'm kind of worrying about when  the next time is going to happen.",840.084,848.428
SPEAKER_01," I get nervous when he tells me, he gives me someone else's phone number, what if something  happens to my phone.",850.802,856.512
SPEAKER_01," That kind of is like, why would you lose your phone?",857.36,861.256
SPEAKER_01, I just think of all these things.,862.88,864.048
SPEAKER_01, How about when he's out?,869.021,870.011
SPEAKER_01," After he's left, what are you thinking then?",871.141,874.699
SPEAKER_01, What is he doing with his friends?,876.769,878.136
SPEAKER_01, Is he someplace he shouldn't be because he's married?,878.96,881.453
SPEAKER_01, Is he talking to somebody else?,882.9,884.698
SPEAKER_01, Why does he not have his phone?,884.92,886.86
SPEAKER_01, Do I have to call him on a different phone?,887.041,889.598
SPEAKER_01, It's several different things.,893.627,894.698
SPEAKER_01, You're anxious something bad is going to happen?,895.061,897.694
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,899.971,900.173
SPEAKER_01, Do you think that there's been any reason for that thinking?,904.261,909.479
SPEAKER_01, Do you think there's any basis for thinking something bad is going to happen?,909.88,911.88
SPEAKER_01, Absolutely not.,912.345,913.032
SPEAKER_01, I love Sarah.,914.244,914.971
SPEAKER_01, The five years that we've spent together have been great.,916.342,919.076
SPEAKER_01, It's just where we are now as opposed to where we first were and when we first got married.,920.942,925.998
SPEAKER_01, It's changed.,926.642,927.207
SPEAKER_01," I would like some independence, just to be on my own sometimes.",929.002,933.139
SPEAKER_01, I guess I don't always relay that well to her and she doesn't understand why I want my space  or I want to go hang out with my friends.,933.48,941.036
SPEAKER_01, I've been trying to explain to her that it's a two-way street.,942.263,946.098
SPEAKER_01, It's not just all one way.,947.08,948.737
SPEAKER_01, We have to work on these issues and that's why we came to you.,949.1,951.392
SPEAKER_01," You're really frustrated by not going out, but you're anxious about when it goes out.",957.08,961.916
SPEAKER_01, We talked about the possibility of an experiment where you go out.,963.482,966.618
SPEAKER_01, It sounds like we might run to the same difficulties you experienced before.,967.16,970.577
SPEAKER_01, What could we change to increase the chances of that experiment working?,971.961,977.519
SPEAKER_01, Don't give me someone else's phone number.,981.103,982.854
SPEAKER_01, Such are starters.,987.064,987.811
SPEAKER_01, Don't be out later than you say that you're coming back.,993.305,997.319
SPEAKER_01," Sometimes it's not too late, but sometimes it's later than what you say.",998.28,1001.436
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes I do call the other phone and there's no answer.,1003.123,1006.818
SPEAKER_01, Just be available when I call.,1008.382,1016.16
SPEAKER_01," If you called when he was out, you'd want an answer.",1021.28,1024.199
SPEAKER_01, Is that something that's normally possible?,1024.924,1026.998
SPEAKER_01, Most of the time I'm very good at responding to her.,1028.383,1030.955
SPEAKER_01," Making sure that she knows I'm okay, making sure that she's okay.",1031.88,1034.815
SPEAKER_01, So that's a compromise you'd be willing to make.,1036.624,1039.317
SPEAKER_01, Absolutely.,1039.941,1040.737
SPEAKER_01, Something like that.,1040.88,1041.819
SPEAKER_01," Any other reassurances from Frank, Sarah?",1044.644,1046.594
SPEAKER_01, I think he means what he says and we can try this again.,1050.88,1055.796
SPEAKER_01, Under some different circumstances.,1057.88,1060.135
SPEAKER_01, Do you have a plan to call Frank when he's out?,1063.88,1067.257
SPEAKER_01, Or is it something that you would do if you just felt the need to?,1067.88,1071.237
SPEAKER_01, I have called a couple times on the different phone and there's no response.,1073.88,1078.455
SPEAKER_01," I hope that when I call again, I'll call his phone and he'll pick up.",1082.041,1086.137
SPEAKER_01, Were you calling for some specific reason?,1087.48,1088.587
SPEAKER_01," Just to talk to him, make sure everything was okay.",1090.58,1094.837
SPEAKER_01, Just that reassurance that everything was going alright.,1096.728,1098.359
SPEAKER_01, So that seems reasonable to you.,1099.285,1100.312
SPEAKER_01," I guess, but at the same time, when I'm out doing my own thing,  I kind of want that privacy and being in the moment.",1102.141,1113.891
SPEAKER_01," Because I know when I get back home, I'm back with you and nothing's changed.",1117.08,1121.899
SPEAKER_01, Because I've always been with you.,1122.1,1123.333
SPEAKER_01, We're still married.,1124.08,1124.59
SPEAKER_01," But when I'm out with my friends and I'm getting a couple phone calls  during the night, over the course of the night,  and it's having to deal with my wife and having to make sure that she knows I'm okay  and everything like that, it gets a little frustrating.",1125.08,1140.02
SPEAKER_01, It's a little...,1140.141,1140.549
SPEAKER_01," I mean, it could be a text too.",1141.08,1142.757
SPEAKER_01, Right.,1143.733,1143.896
SPEAKER_01, Would that be a good compromise?,1144.801,1146.599
SPEAKER_01, Or is it a text or two?,1146.68,1147.771
SPEAKER_01, I guess that could work.,1148.963,1149.811
