, Okay.,11.0,11.082
SPEAKER_01," I don't know if you remember from the first session that I had told you about, but I was  hoping we could start today by beginning your treatment plan.",14.586,23.899
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,24.143,24.816
SPEAKER_01, I don't know if you remember from the first session that I had told you around session  four that we would start your treatment plan and try to finish it around session five.,25.221,36.037
, Okay.,37.122,37.408
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,38.02,38.224
SPEAKER_01," So the treatment plan, I usually like the treatment plan to have two or three goals  and each goal has some objectives.",39.0,44.832
SPEAKER_01, So today I thought we'd just work on one goal.,46.0,47.859
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,48.0,48.122
SPEAKER_01, All right.,49.184,49.918
SPEAKER_01, And I'll kind of get that down and then give you some time to think about it until next  week and then kind of work on the other goals from there.,50.281,58.0
SPEAKER_01, We'll finish off the treatment plan next week.,58.222,60.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,60.49,60.714

SPEAKER_01, That sound okay to you?,62.0,62.673
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,63.163,63.694
SPEAKER_01, So the goal is kind of like your overarching goal for therapy in general.,64.201,70.037
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,71.306,71.959
SPEAKER_01, All right.,72.0,72.265
SPEAKER_01, Which I'm going to note too are specific tasks you can do that will help you achieve that  goal.,74.0,81.959
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,82.0,82.082
SPEAKER_01," So they're specific, they're measurable, and we hope they're achievable.",83.06,87.92
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,88.673,88.939
SPEAKER_01, Does that make sense?,89.102,89.918
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,90.061,90.204
SPEAKER_01, So you have like an overall goal in mind for our counseling sessions?,91.201,97.576
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,100.313,100.636
SPEAKER_00," I would like to be able to kind of, I've been feeling a little depressed and I would really  like to be able to reduce those, you know, the depression.",102.0,113.217
SPEAKER_01, So reduce feelings of depression?,114.725,116.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,117.061,117.286
SPEAKER_01, That would be your goal.,118.0,118.653
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,119.163,119.612
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,120.0,120.082
SPEAKER_01, Sounds like a good goal.,121.0,122.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,122.082,122.429
SPEAKER_01," So what objectives, what tasks do you think that you could do that would help you to feel  less depressed?",123.341,134.589
SPEAKER_00," I guess maybe some sort of physical activity, maybe like walking.",141.321,149.0
SPEAKER_00," I like to be outside, so maybe walking could be one.",150.0,154.859
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,155.531,155.735
SPEAKER_01, Have you had a plan before where you've walked regularly?,157.064,160.719
SPEAKER_00," You know, I used to.",161.667,162.677
SPEAKER_00, I did.,163.525,163.848
SPEAKER_00, And it would give me some relief because I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking.,165.341,172.619
SPEAKER_00," So yes, yes.",174.685,176.376
SPEAKER_00, I've had success with walking before.,177.06,179.275
SPEAKER_01, So walking has worked before?,180.082,181.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,181.041,181.102
SPEAKER_01, And you've noticed that you're walking less since you've had a feelings of depression?,182.623,186.0
SPEAKER_00, I have been.,186.388,186.857
SPEAKER_00, I really haven't been doing too much of anything.,187.162,189.0
SPEAKER_00," I've just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over getting homework done because  I'm back in school and it's been so stressful and overwhelming.",189.2,204.0
SPEAKER_00," Like I said, it's just kind of got me in this little funk, this depressed mood.",204.08,209.599
SPEAKER_01," Well, since you're on the topic of homework, is there something you think you can do there?",211.486,214.859
SPEAKER_01, You mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming and that sounds like the type of feelings  that are related to depression sometimes.,215.0,222.497
SPEAKER_01, Do you find that kind of being stressed about the homework is?,224.421,228.656
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, because you know, it's so much work to be done and sometimes I get several assignments  due and at the same time I find myself rushing to get assignments in and you know, it can  just be a little daunting.",230.702,248.919
SPEAKER_00, It's just overwhelming sometimes.,249.041,250.0
SPEAKER_00," So yeah, and I don't know, maybe if I spaced it out and you know, took, you know, did some  time management or something like that, I don't know, to kind of help me with that.",250.261,264.96
SPEAKER_01, So you feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due?,265.0,269.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah.",269.687,270.879
SPEAKER_01," So that's where the feeling, maybe overwhelmed?",271.644,273.98
SPEAKER_00," Yes, I would say that.",274.687,275.737
, Yeah.,276.102,276.776
SPEAKER_01," So yeah, you're right, it sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right?",277.583,280.98
SPEAKER_01," So if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier and do it in  small bits instead of waiting more or less the last minute, that would reduce, I mean  likely I would think, reduce some of the stress and feelings of being overwhelmed.",281.321,302.438
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I'm sure it would.",303.343,304.939
SPEAKER_00, You sure would.,305.061,305.51
SPEAKER_01, So you want to make that your second objective then?,306.02,307.859
SPEAKER_01, So you have the walking.,308.224,309.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,309.02,309.163
SPEAKER_01, And then you'll have trying to space out the homework.,310.562,315.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, okay.",315.02,315.551
SPEAKER_00, That sounds doable.,316.143,316.837
SPEAKER_00, That sound good?,317.0,317.939
SPEAKER_01, All right.,318.02,318.449
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,319.0,319.122
SPEAKER_01," So we have, so we have the walking and then spacing out the homework a little more.",321.103,327.98
SPEAKER_01," So that's two objectives and both of those seem tied to the feelings, to the oppressive  feelings that you're trying to eliminate.",328.04,336.98
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,337.367,337.612
SPEAKER_01, What other objectives might work?,338.624,339.933
SPEAKER_00, Let's see.,341.626,342.051
SPEAKER_00," You know, since I've been back in school, I just kind of, you know, I used to love to  sing and I haven't done that in a while.",343.742,353.719
SPEAKER_00," And so maybe getting out and singing again and, you know, socializing with my friends  that I used to sing with, maybe that could help because it would get me out of the house,  you know.",354.902,370.343
SPEAKER_01, Has that worked in the past for you?,372.04,373.576
SPEAKER_00," You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing.",374.303,375.859
SPEAKER_00," And right now I feel like I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because  I've been so busy doing work, doing homework.",376.583,383.98
SPEAKER_00, So I think that would probably help.,384.201,387.0
SPEAKER_01," So it's a good break from thinking about, stressing about, as you put it, the homework.",387.762,394.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,394.0,394.061
SPEAKER_01, For you.,395.347,395.673
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,396.714,396.796
SPEAKER_01," It has kind of a, I mean the singing part's fun for you it sounds like, but also there's  a social component it seems like.",397.02,402.0
SPEAKER_00," Yes, it is.",402.429,402.918
SPEAKER_00, It is.,403.143,403.388
SPEAKER_00," So I enjoy, like I said, I enjoy singing and, you know, I enjoy the people that I would  sing with and we would go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs  or events, you know, different bands that we're playing at, you know, it would just  be nice.",405.04,419.327
SPEAKER_00, It's fun.,420.02,420.918
SPEAKER_00, So I love music.,421.242,422.879
SPEAKER_00," So I love listening to it and I love, you know, singing.",423.584,426.0
SPEAKER_00, So making music.,426.404,427.939
SPEAKER_00," So that would be, I think that would be a good goal.",428.826,430.859
SPEAKER_01, You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing.,431.382,434.457
SPEAKER_00," Yes, I just love it.",435.242,436.778
SPEAKER_00, I enjoy doing it and I just haven't had a chance to do it lately.,437.0,439.718
SPEAKER_01, So part of this is just making the time.,440.866,442.96
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,443.449,443.714
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,444.0,444.184
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,445.041,445.327
SPEAKER_01, Good.,446.796,446.939
SPEAKER_01, All right.,447.0,447.469
SPEAKER_01, So we'll make that a third objective.,448.0,449.919
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,450.245,450.51
SPEAKER_01, So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently.,451.321,456.197
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,457.02,457.796
SPEAKER_01, And singing and that socializing that accompanies that singing.,458.0,463.819
SPEAKER_01, That's great.,464.0,464.347
SPEAKER_01," So, three objectives is good.",465.525,467.0
SPEAKER_01, I try to get to four if you have one.,467.303,468.778
SPEAKER_01," Is there a fourth objective that you can think of, something else that you associated with  not feeling depressed?",469.02,476.467
SPEAKER_00," Well, I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt.",479.942,486.799
SPEAKER_00, And so that's two things.,488.067,489.94
SPEAKER_00, The beach.,490.082,490.796
SPEAKER_00, I love the beach because it's soothing.,491.444,492.818
SPEAKER_00, It's comforting.,493.364,494.515
SPEAKER_00," And my aunt, she's just such an awesome person.",495.342,498.0
SPEAKER_00, She's always pouring into me and I just love spending time with her.,498.281,501.618
SPEAKER_01, And she lives down at the beach.,502.889,503.939
SPEAKER_00," Yes, she does.",504.265,505.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,505.388,505.653
SPEAKER_01," So that's, it seems like a good objective too.",506.0,508.678
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,509.041,509.286
SPEAKER_01," So, you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often?",510.341,514.94
SPEAKER_00," Yes, again, just at home doing homework and I haven't gone to visit her.",515.822,522.479
SPEAKER_00, And the thing is she only lives like an hour away.,523.06,525.597
SPEAKER_01, So it's not a huge ride.,526.626,527.98
SPEAKER_00," No, it's not.",528.0,528.592
SPEAKER_00, So that's like a little trip I can do on a Saturday.,529.161,533.92
SPEAKER_00, So I can take a break and go down there and spend some time with her.,534.804,537.337
SPEAKER_00, I think that would be helpful.,538.201,539.409
SPEAKER_01," So again, kind of getting away from the school stressors and kind of just taking a break from it for a day.",541.441,550.539
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,551.592,551.714
SPEAKER_01, And then also spending time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with.,552.0,554.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,555.714,555.939
SPEAKER_01, Good.,557.027,557.208
SPEAKER_01, Good.,559.082,559.224
SPEAKER_01, All right.,560.061,560.408
SPEAKER_01, So I want to go through each one of these.,561.0,561.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,562.143,562.51
SPEAKER_01," And make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do.",563.442,567.458
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,568.082,568.714
SPEAKER_01," These are all specific, which is good.",569.0,571.513
SPEAKER_01, Do you feel these are all achievable?,573.141,575.114
SPEAKER_01, These are things you can do?,576.0,576.959
SPEAKER_00, I think so.,577.51,577.939
SPEAKER_00, Yes?,578.163,578.327
SPEAKER_00," Yes, I do.",579.102,579.612
SPEAKER_01," Well, some of them you've done in the past, right?",580.0,581.0
SPEAKER_00, Right.,581.265,581.449
SPEAKER_01, So now we have the specific and the achievable.,583.003,588.077
SPEAKER_01," Now I want to get to parts a little more tricky, which is making it measurable.",589.181,592.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,592.082,592.306
SPEAKER_01," What I'd like to do here, and I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives.",593.04,596.98
SPEAKER_01, I want you to decide.,597.204,597.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,598.0,598.122
SPEAKER_01," But I want to see if we can quantify in some manner how often you'll be able to do these different things, or how, you know, like in the homework,  we'll have to think about the spacing would be the quantity.",599.02,611.879
SPEAKER_01, But first with the walking.,612.505,613.636
SPEAKER_01, Right.,614.0,614.306
SPEAKER_01," So in a given week, say, what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking?",615.281,619.9
SPEAKER_01, How many times?,620.0,620.622
SPEAKER_00, Maybe I can start out with twice a week.,627.101,630.98
SPEAKER_01, Twice a week.,631.531,632.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,632.04,632.201
SPEAKER_01, Do you have two particular days in mind?,635.525,637.0
SPEAKER_01, Days where your responsibilities aren't too great and you have that opportunity?,637.322,641.0
SPEAKER_00, Maybe we need to start with one day a week.,649.597,650.98
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,651.041,651.184
SPEAKER_01, Let's go with one day a week.,652.286,652.98
SPEAKER_01, Let's go one time.,653.04,654.98

SPEAKER_00, Let's start with one and then we'll see what happens.,656.465,658.0
SPEAKER_01, That's a good start.,659.253,659.899

SPEAKER_00, Yes.,698.061,698.204
SPEAKER_00," Off work and give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door because  if I make it too late, I'm not going to go.",699.642,709.839

, All right.,727.082,727.633

SPEAKER_01, This is a little trickier.,729.263,731.0
SPEAKER_01, All right.,731.122,731.98
SPEAKER_01, So this is about spacing it out.,732.0,733.657

SPEAKER_00," The average, maybe about two hours, two and a half hours, I guess.",751.742,759.94
SPEAKER_01," Well, let's go with the worst case.",760.082,761.0
SPEAKER_01, Let's go two and a half hours just to cover the worst case.,761.161,764.0
SPEAKER_01, Would that generally be the worst case?,764.384,765.96
," I think so, maybe.",766.765,768.195

SPEAKER_01, Yes.,987.408,987.49
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,988.061,988.184
SPEAKER_01, So you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night.,989.02,991.839

SPEAKER_01, And have the rest of that time off.,993.02,994.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,994.0,994.286
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,995.02,995.245
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,996.163,996.286
SPEAKER_01, Are you sure that's achievable?,997.0,997.918
SPEAKER_01, That seems like you're getting a lot in there.,999.43,1000.96
SPEAKER_01, Do you think you can do it?,1001.303,1002.111
SPEAKER_00, I'll get dry.,1003.0,1003.857
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,1004.265,1004.449
SPEAKER_01, That sounds good.,1005.0,1005.633

SPEAKER_00, What time Sunday?,1007.0,1007.98
SPEAKER_00, Sunday around 5.,1008.04,1009.03

SPEAKER_00," 5 to 6, yes.",1011.263,1011.505
SPEAKER_01," And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of asked me on the high side, but  if it did, would you be able to go 5 to 7?",1013.161,1019.497
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,1020.102,1020.347
SPEAKER_01, So that's kind of like flexible time there.,1021.02,1023.114
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1024.082,1024.49
SPEAKER_01, So what would that feel like to get your homework done by Sunday?,1025.0,1026.616
SPEAKER_00, It would be a relief.,1027.323,1028.596
SPEAKER_00," And then I could do some other stuff like, you know, maybe my next goal.",1030.0,1034.016
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1035.082,1035.367
SPEAKER_01," So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on  Sunday, where you need more time and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday  after you walk, bacon.",1036.401,1048.0
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,1048.0,1048.265
SPEAKER_01, So that could be like your backup.,1049.041,1049.959
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1050.02,1050.143
SPEAKER_01, Does that make sense?,1051.041,1051.694
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1052.429,1052.592
SPEAKER_01, Because you still have another six days to have done after that.,1053.0,1054.973
SPEAKER_01, Right.,1056.429,1056.592
SPEAKER_01, Does that seem realistic and achievable?,1057.0,1058.657
SPEAKER_00, It does.,1059.163,1059.857
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1060.0,1060.327
SPEAKER_01, So how about the singing?,1061.0,1061.735
SPEAKER_01," I have no idea how long the singing thing takes, so.",1062.0,1064.171
SPEAKER_00," Well, if I get back in the group that I was in, we would normally get together on a Friday  after work.",1066.682,1074.706
SPEAKER_01," Every Friday, every so many Fridays?",1076.224,1078.717
SPEAKER_00, Every Friday.,1079.723,1080.814
SPEAKER_00, Every Friday.,1081.4,1081.866
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,1083.082,1083.592
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1084.449,1084.571
SPEAKER_00," So on Fridays, it would just be rehearsal.",1085.0,1086.616
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1087.082,1087.306
SPEAKER_00," And then another Friday, it would be a shorter rehearsal, and then we would go someplace  if we knew of a group of some friends of ours that were performing.",1088.502,1098.294
SPEAKER_01," So this is an every Friday commitment, right, the singing?",1100.281,1104.0
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,1104.51,1104.837
SPEAKER_00," But one Friday is generally, it's like the end, about two hours.",1105.0,1110.0
SPEAKER_01, About two hours.,1110.122,1110.939
SPEAKER_01, So two hours every Friday.,1111.626,1112.838
SPEAKER_01," This is something you really enjoy, though.",1113.02,1114.0
SPEAKER_00, It is.,1114.163,1114.653
SPEAKER_01, So it sounds like you look forward to it.,1115.202,1116.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1117.041,1117.102
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,1118.714,1118.939
SPEAKER_01, All right.,1119.0,1119.49
SPEAKER_01," So Friday, two hours, I guess, would be the afternoon or evening?",1120.0,1122.995
SPEAKER_01, Evening.,1124.224,1124.51
, Evening.,1125.02,1125.224
, Okay.,1126.122,1126.449
, All right.,1127.102,1128.0
SPEAKER_01, So that's one that you would kind of look forward to.,1128.703,1132.538
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1133.286,1133.408
SPEAKER_01, The singing.,1134.592,1134.939
SPEAKER_01, That's good.,1135.082,1135.449
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1136.041,1136.633
SPEAKER_01, So that's one you feel you could achieve a couple hours on Friday.,1137.161,1139.557
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1140.49,1140.592
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,1141.0,1141.122
SPEAKER_00, So I think it was something that came up that I really had to get done.,1142.0,1144.758
SPEAKER_00, It's not like I can't not go.,1145.705,1147.597
SPEAKER_01, So...,1148.367,1148.531
SPEAKER_01, It won't be managed or anything?,1149.041,1149.959
SPEAKER_01, No.,1150.0,1150.082
SPEAKER_01, No.,1151.224,1151.327
SPEAKER_01, They know I'm in school.,1152.0,1153.0
SPEAKER_01," In school, they understand.",1153.02,1153.857
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,1154.02,1154.184
SPEAKER_01, Good.,1155.041,1156.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1156.0,1156.163
SPEAKER_01, So then there's the last objective.,1157.02,1158.0
SPEAKER_01," This is, I guess, about a whole day commitment, right, because you go to the beach.",1158.623,1161.859
SPEAKER_01," It's an hour drive, so you probably wouldn't want to go down for just a few hours.",1162.523,1165.0
SPEAKER_01, No.,1165.02,1165.061
SPEAKER_01, Probably more like the whole day.,1166.0,1166.878
SPEAKER_01, No.,1167.755,1167.796
SPEAKER_01, Would they...,1168.02,1168.449
SPEAKER_00, That would be more like a Saturday.,1169.505,1170.98
SPEAKER_01, But of course it wouldn't be every Saturday.,1171.624,1173.396
SPEAKER_01," So how many times in, say, a month?",1174.04,1176.698
SPEAKER_01, Like once?,1177.102,1177.857
SPEAKER_01, Once a month.,1178.286,1178.714
SPEAKER_01, Once a month.,1179.0,1179.857
, Okay.,1180.082,1180.306
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1181.531,1181.776
SPEAKER_01, So you would go down on Saturday morning and come back that same day?,1182.582,1188.94
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1189.041,1189.265
SPEAKER_01, Is that something you look forward to?,1190.707,1191.717
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,1192.02,1192.224
SPEAKER_01," Is that something that would be okay in terms of like, because on Friday night potentially  you'd be out, right?",1193.06,1199.859
SPEAKER_01, And then Saturday.,1200.082,1200.776
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,1201.735,1201.918
SPEAKER_00," But if I, if on those Saturdays that I know that I'm going, I could not be out too late  on that.",1202.1,1208.837
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1209.776,1209.959
SPEAKER_01, That's a good idea.,1210.041,1210.612
SPEAKER_01, So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out.,1211.06,1213.497
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1214.388,1214.469
SPEAKER_01, When you know that Saturday's coming.,1215.0,1216.0
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,1216.082,1216.163
SPEAKER_01, Or not go at all that Friday.,1217.404,1218.616
SPEAKER_01, Either way.,1219.0,1219.245
SPEAKER_01, Just take a break that time.,1220.041,1220.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1221.102,1221.224
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,1222.204,1222.367
SPEAKER_01, Re-store.,1223.265,1223.551
SPEAKER_01, All right.,1224.469,1224.735
SPEAKER_01, So that's four separate objectives.,1225.0,1226.192
SPEAKER_01," And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want  to take a moment, just take a break and print this up for you.",1227.321,1236.899
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1237.143,1237.408
SPEAKER_01," We'll work on the rest of your goals next time, but I want you to have this so you can  get started on it right away.",1238.141,1244.091
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1245.306,1245.429
SPEAKER_01," So before I print these up, is there any changes you want to make?",1246.0,1247.95
SPEAKER_00, No.,1250.939,1250.98
SPEAKER_00," I would like to try that and if it doesn't work, can we tweak it?",1252.286,1254.96
SPEAKER_01, Oh yeah.,1255.204,1255.694
SPEAKER_01, Just make changes.,1256.0,1256.469
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1257.694,1257.878
SPEAKER_01, Maybe certain things will work really well.,1258.0,1259.394
SPEAKER_01, Maybe certain things will have to take off the list altogether and maybe substitute something  else.,1260.02,1264.306
SPEAKER_01," But yeah, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here.",1265.0,1267.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1268.0,1268.122
SPEAKER_01, We can just make a document that changes as needed.,1269.02,1271.416
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1272.0,1272.082
SPEAKER_01," But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go ahead and print this up as it is and  give you a copy and we can resume with today's session and then next time I see you in a  week, we'll work on the rest of the treatment plan.",1273.361,1287.0
SPEAKER_01, Sounds good.,1287.0,1287.918
SPEAKER_01, Does that sound like a good plan?,1288.02,1289.253
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1290.429,1290.592
