SPEAKER_00, I got here in about 15 or 20 minutes.,24.7,25.973
SPEAKER_00," Oh, that's good.",26.865,27.32
SPEAKER_00, I was held up.,27.32,27.999
SPEAKER_01, There was a big smash on the road so it took me a little bit longer.,28.08,31.12
SPEAKER_01, So I'm glad that you were able to make it in.,31.2,32.715
SPEAKER_01, Thank you.,33.241,33.633
SPEAKER_01, That's good.,33.9,34.451
SPEAKER_01," Julie, I'm glad that you've made the effort to come in today.",34.98,37.859
SPEAKER_01, How did you hear about our service?,38.02,39.313
SPEAKER_00," Well, I was talking to a friend and saying that I thought I might benefit from having a chat to somebody.",39.98,45.018
SPEAKER_00, And she told me that one of her friends had actually come to your service before and said that it was very good.,45.54,50.619
SPEAKER_00, Excellent.,51.081,51.591
SPEAKER_01," Well, thank you for coming in.",52.12,53.272
SPEAKER_01," When you came in, you filled out some forms, which the girls have given me, which is great.",54.04,57.72
SPEAKER_01, So that gives me a little bit of a background to where you're from and things of that nature.,57.8,62.478
SPEAKER_01, And I just wanted to start by saying that our service is a counselling service for women.,63.081,68.139
SPEAKER_01," And therefore you fit that category, which is really good.",68.761,71.577
SPEAKER_01," Now, I just wanted to let you know that this is our first initial interview, I guess.",72.16,77.479
SPEAKER_01," So today we will be just setting some, I'll be hearing some of your story.",77.72,81.698
SPEAKER_01, And we'll work through a little bit of a process.,82.341,84.499
SPEAKER_01, And then I'm sure we'll get the opportunity to meet again.,84.68,87.136
SPEAKER_01, Is that okay?,87.843,88.272
SPEAKER_01, That sounds good.,88.64,89.45
SPEAKER_01,Thank you.,89.491,89.916
SPEAKER_01, Excellent.,90.281,90.77
SPEAKER_01," Now, within the pack that I've given you, or the girls at the front have given you, Julie,  there is some information on how we keep your privacy and confidentiality.",91.762,101.1
SPEAKER_01, So I just wanted to clarify that before we go into our session today.,101.28,105.316
SPEAKER_01," So within the community centre here,  we do, everything that you say to me today is kept within a confidential environment.",106.34,116.418
SPEAKER_01," However, I am a mandatory reporter, which means that if you tell me something that I feel that  you may be at risk, or you may be at risk of harm to yourself or hurting someone else.",116.96,126.598
SPEAKER_01," If you have children, if they may be at risk, or if you're participating in illegal activity,  I am a mandatory reporter, and I will need to let somebody know about that  so that we can try to get you some help and assistance in dealing with that particular situation.",127.24,140.078
SPEAKER_01, Is that okay?,140.582,141.213
SPEAKER_01," Yes, that's fine.",141.701,142.648
SPEAKER_01,I understand.,142.688,143.414
SPEAKER_01,Thank you.,143.434,143.978
SPEAKER_01, Excellent.,144.403,144.871
SPEAKER_01," So Julie, let's just start by, what has brought you here today?",145.44,149.835
SPEAKER_00," Well, my husband and I have been fighting on and off the last couple of months,  and I'm just noticing that we can't seem to come to any agreement lately.",151.3,163.297
SPEAKER_00," I'm losing sleep, I'm feeling exhausted,  and I'm at a point where I feel like I might like to leave the marriage.",164.261,171.157
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,172.061,172.404
SPEAKER_01,How long have you been married for?,172.464,173.876
SPEAKER_00, We've been together for eight years.,174.642,176.076
SPEAKER_01," Oh, wow.",176.902,177.384
SPEAKER_01,Okay.,177.404,177.766
SPEAKER_01,That's a decent amount of time.,178.248,180.679
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,181.124,181.371
SPEAKER_00, And do you have any children?,181.7,182.774
SPEAKER_00," Yes, we have three children.",183.3,184.627
SPEAKER_00,"I have two little ones that are under five,  and we have a seven-year-old who's at school.",184.647,189.236
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,189.801,190.083
SPEAKER_00,So you must be kept busy then?,190.123,191.635
SPEAKER_00, I'm always very busy.,192.34,193.388
SPEAKER_00,"There's just always so much to do,  and I'm really feeling very tired.",193.428,196.837
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,197.2,198.666
SPEAKER_00,"And the children today, whereabouts?",198.686,200.313
SPEAKER_00,Who's looking after them today for you?,200.353,202.1
SPEAKER_00," Well, my two younger children today are being cared for by my mum,  and my oldest one is at school today.",202.22,207.597
SPEAKER_00, Excellent.,208.041,208.505
SPEAKER_00,And where's your husband today?,208.727,209.977
SPEAKER_00, He's gone to work.,210.503,211.374
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,211.941,212.386
SPEAKER_01,That's good.,212.548,213.054
SPEAKER_01," So it seems as if you're at a point in your marriage where you're feeling  as if the marriage has changed a little bit, and it's focused,  and you're kind of a little bit worried about what the future holds  for yourself and your husband.",213.701,229.135
SPEAKER_00, I am.,229.941,230.442
SPEAKER_00,"I feel now that I can't come to any solution with the problems,  and he's been drinking a lot, and he always enjoyed a social drink  when we first got married, but I'm noticing now that he's drinking more and more.",231.083,246.66
SPEAKER_00," He seems to be drinking most days of the week, and when he does drink,  he's very, very difficult to talk to.",246.74,252.551
SPEAKER_01, So the alcohol seems to be a problem.,254.081,256.998
SPEAKER_01, Do you think that might be relating to the changing behaviour  that you mentioned earlier?,257.401,261.153
SPEAKER_00," Yes, I do.",262.021,262.644
SPEAKER_00,"I think that the drinking has definitely changed his behaviour  significantly, and he's very unreasonable, and he has a very short fuse.",262.664,270.64
SPEAKER_00," He's very, very easy to make angry over the smallest of things.",270.74,276.017
SPEAKER_00, OK.,277.161,277.522
SPEAKER_01,So that must be difficult for you and the children.,278.003,282.98
SPEAKER_01, Have you noticed if the children have picked up on the change in his behaviour?,283.361,287.256
SPEAKER_00," Well, he does have a very good relationship with the children,  and he actively participates in their daily lives,  and the children haven't mentioned anything to me,  and they don't seem to have changed their behaviour in any way.",288.541,300.337
SPEAKER_00, The arguments don't tend to happen in front of the children either.,300.981,303.798
SPEAKER_01, OK.,304.301,304.763
SPEAKER_01,Are the arguments something that...,305.226,307.779
SPEAKER_01," Is it over more trivial things, or are there big, key things  that you're kind of arguing with him about?",307.94,314.695
SPEAKER_00," Well, the arguments can start over something small.",315.501,318.137
SPEAKER_00, It can be just a simple argument over a task in the house.,318.64,322.357
SPEAKER_00," That can escalate into an argument about his family,  or about my mother, or about money issues,  and it just seems to escalate out of control.",322.98,332.675
, OK.,333.4,333.822
SPEAKER_01,"So, Julie, have you...",334.727,335.952
SPEAKER_01," In terms of his drinking,  I'm kind of just trying to ascertain maybe what has developed in your marriage  that's taken you to the point that potentially, you know,  you've come to see me today.",337.982,350.255
SPEAKER_01," And it appears as if the drinking is really the focus  of perhaps your feeling of, you know,  wanting to disconnect from the marriage  and feeling isolated within the marriage.",350.901,364.18
SPEAKER_01, Would that be right?,364.281,365.735
SPEAKER_00, That's true.,366.321,367.41
SPEAKER_00,That's right.,367.531,368.157
SPEAKER_00," I think the drinking is my main issue with his behaviour,  and I think the drinking is greatly contributing  to the way that he's behaving towards me.",368.681,379.652
SPEAKER_01, Have you spoken to him about this?,381.041,383.433
SPEAKER_00, I have.,384.901,385.444
SPEAKER_00,"I've tried to talk to him about the drinking a couple of times,  and he just gets very, very defensive with me.",385.665,390.495
SPEAKER_01, Potentially he's not acknowledging then that he may have a drinking problem.,391.34,395.558
SPEAKER_01, That's true.,396.201,396.807
SPEAKER_01,That's correct.,396.887,397.574
SPEAKER_01,Yes.,397.634,397.917
SPEAKER_01, OK.,398.36,398.782
SPEAKER_01,"I can understand that this must be difficult for you, Julie,  and I'm pleased that you've come here today  to try to, you know, work through some of these issues.",400.047,409.957
SPEAKER_01," Now, Julie, in terms of, I guess, your commitment to the marriage,  in terms of where you want the marriage kind of to go,  do you think that you have a strong base that you can potentially,  you know, if we were able to help your husband  with the drinking side of things,  that your marriage itself might be strong enough to overcome  and to move forward in the relationship?",410.66,436.419
SPEAKER_01," Or, you know, tell me a little bit about what your thoughts are with that.",436.861,440.278
SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm hopeful that we could resolve the issues that we're having,  and although at the moment I feel like I need to break away from him,  if he was able to get the support that he needed  and we were able to get the support together,  I think that I would be willing to give the marriage an opportunity  to continue and to resolve our issues.",440.82,462.037
SPEAKER_01, OK.,462.561,463.023
SPEAKER_01,"Julie, in terms of your own support,  you mentioned your mum's looking after the children today.",463.687,468.678
SPEAKER_01, Do you... Would you consider yourself to have friends and family that you...,469.04,472.899
SPEAKER_01," You know, have you spoken to anyone else about this issue?",473.16,475.516
SPEAKER_00," Well, I have.",476.201,476.724
SPEAKER_00,"I spoke to my girlfriend who recommended your service,  and she's a very good support to me and to the children.",476.784,482.457
SPEAKER_00, And I have a very supportive family network as well.,483.121,486.48
SPEAKER_00," I have sisters who live in Sydney and also my mum,  so they're all around me and they're very, very caring towards me.",486.54,492.917
SPEAKER_00, Have any of those...,493.641,494.391
SPEAKER_01, Any of the family or friends noticed a change in your husband's behaviour?,495.181,498.539
SPEAKER_00," Yes, they have.",498.881,499.886
SPEAKER_00,"Actually, recently we had a social function  and my brother did comment to me on how much alcohol my husband consumed  at this social event.",499.987,508.756
SPEAKER_00, OK.,509.28,509.642
SPEAKER_01,"So this is impacting on you as well as the, I guess, the extended family as well.",509.983,514.279
SPEAKER_01," Well, it's really good to hear that you do have a support network  outside of this room, I guess, which is really, really good.",514.72,520.78
SPEAKER_01," And it's great that you've got that,  and I'd encourage you to use your mum and your family and friends,  you know, as a gentle ear to listen,  to, you know, to help you support yourself and the children through this phase  or this stage in your relationship with your husband.",521.726,539.455
SPEAKER_01," So, Julie, I'm just trying to think about potentially...",540.381,544.716
SPEAKER_01," Just to recap, so you're saying that your relationship with your husband  has changed from what it was.",545.76,552.719
SPEAKER_01, You've been with him for about eight years and you have got three children.,552.84,555.773
SPEAKER_01, You've mentioned that the primary changes his behaviour  and that you believe that it probably is linked to his change in drinking habits.,557.36,567.72
SPEAKER_01, That's right.,567.82,569.096
SPEAKER_01," And from what I understand, you've expressed that you would be happy  to potentially work with him to resolve or seek help for him  in relation to his drinking habits.",569.52,580.835
SPEAKER_01, How old do you... Would that be right in what I've said there?,581.5,585.0
SPEAKER_00," Yes, that's right.",585.0,586.152
SPEAKER_00,That's correct.,586.192,586.899
SPEAKER_00, I would be happy to work on things if he was willing to do that as well.,587.0,591.056
SPEAKER_01," Not knowing your husband, I guess I would probably need to ask you if...",592.32,595.736
SPEAKER_01, Do you think that your husband would be receptive to maybe some marriage counselling  or going to see somebody about his drinking?,596.56,606.14
SPEAKER_01, Is he the type of person that might be receptive to that or...?,606.16,608.895
SPEAKER_00, I think he would.,609.862,610.696
SPEAKER_00," I think if I was able to approach him when he was calm and relaxed,  I think that, yes, he probably would be receptive to that.",611.0,618.957
SPEAKER_00, OK.,619.481,619.863
SPEAKER_01,That's positive.,620.93,621.634
SPEAKER_01,"That's really good,  because some people that I meet, you know, the answer to that would be quite different.",621.735,626.86
SPEAKER_01," So I think that's really positive for you, Julie.",626.92,629.271
SPEAKER_01, I think what we probably need to look at now is maybe continuing this relationship between you and I.,631.18,638.1
SPEAKER_01, So I'd love to see you again and meet up with you again.,638.24,640.896
SPEAKER_01," But also, too, I think we probably need to explore that avenue  of either getting you some marriage counselling or something along those lines,  as well as seeing whether or not your husband might be interested in looking at some services  to help him with his drinking issues that he has.",641.601,660.395
SPEAKER_01," So if it's OK by you, what we might do from here is organise for us to meet again.",661.881,666.576
SPEAKER_01, What time is best for you?,668.161,669.593
SPEAKER_00," Around this time is a good time for me,  and any Thursday or Friday during the day is good.",671.084,676.774
SPEAKER_00, OK.,678.361,678.622
SPEAKER_01,"So what we'll do is we'll organise maybe for this time next week,  and we'll meet again.",678.742,684.298
SPEAKER_01," But in the meantime, I think we probably need to put you in contact with a relationships counsellor,  and we'll try to get that side of things going.",684.48,695.76
SPEAKER_01," And as a result of that, we'll be able to work out how receptive your husband is  of potentially seeking some help for him as well.",696.041,704.296
SPEAKER_01, I would like to just say that you mentioned that you probably would like to escape a little bit from it at the moment.,705.38,711.157
SPEAKER_01, So perhaps I might be able to give you some advice or some information on some things  that you might be able to do to take yourself away from that situation.,712.3,721.099
SPEAKER_01," If you feel as if it's a little bit too much,  maybe you might like to tap into your mum or your family and friends as well  if you don't feel comfortable using some of the other services in the area.",721.28,731.556
SPEAKER_01, How do you feel about that?,732.461,733.377
SPEAKER_01, That would be good.,733.701,734.487
SPEAKER_01,I'd appreciate that.,734.507,735.473
SPEAKER_01,Thank you.,735.514,735.937
SPEAKER_01, OK.,736.4,736.682
SPEAKER_01,"Well, thank you, Julie, for taking the time.",737.045,738.8
SPEAKER_01," I'm really happy that you were able to come in today,  and I look forward to going on this journey with you.",738.861,743.535
SPEAKER_01, It's not a solution.,744.46,745.386
SPEAKER_01,We can't fix everything here today.,745.406,747.519
SPEAKER_01, It will be a process.,747.681,748.612
SPEAKER_01, But hopefully together we can see a really positive outcome for you  and your family.,749.943,755.576
SPEAKER_00, Thank you very much for talking to me today.,756.282,758.193
SPEAKER_00,That's been great.,758.213,758.917
SPEAKER_00,Thank you.,758.957,759.299
SPEAKER_00, And I look forward to seeing you next week.,759.501,761.198
SPEAKER_00, Thank you very much.,761.481,762.418
