SPEAKER_01," Hi Lisa, how are you doing today?",15.399,16.2
SPEAKER_00, I'm doing okay.,16.946,17.654
SPEAKER_01, Did you make it here okay to the office?,18.886,20.156
SPEAKER_00, I did.,20.682,20.927
SPEAKER_00, Traffic wasn't too bad.,21.62,22.559
SPEAKER_01," Good, good.",22.845,23.539
SPEAKER_01, So I understand that you've come to see me because you have a situation.,24.142,28.175
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I'm just been a lot of anxiety right now.",29.76,32.599
SPEAKER_00, My oldest child is moving out and I know as a mom that that's the goal is to let them  be independent and start on their own but still a little concerned that it's going to  work out and that he's in a good place and living where he should and going to eat dinner  and do those things that you worry about them doing.,32.7,51.975
SPEAKER_01," Okay, I'll try to help you with that.",53.506,54.618
SPEAKER_01, I'm sure your year gets started.,54.841,56.594
SPEAKER_00, Absolutely.,57.422,57.891
SPEAKER_00, The sooner the better.,58.603,59.229
SPEAKER_01, Good.,60.871,61.116
SPEAKER_01, I want to make sure I go over a few disclosures about the counseling relationship before we  get into assessment which is the first stage.,61.481,69.878
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,70.381,70.524
SPEAKER_01, Right.,71.381,71.565
SPEAKER_01, We'll ask you a lot of questions.,72.34,73.32
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,73.524,73.769
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,74.34,74.463
SPEAKER_01, About your past and what's going on now and then after assessment we'll move into counseling.,75.32,79.457
SPEAKER_01, So we'll come in roughly once a week.,80.24,82.236
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,82.964,83.25
SPEAKER_01, And then we'll get through kind of a piece on confidentiality.,83.82,88.159
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so like attorneys what you can do and not do and...",89.103,92.814
SPEAKER_01, Kind of.,94.72,95.189
SPEAKER_01, I'm glad you brought that up about attorneys.,95.74,97.46
SPEAKER_01, Attorneys and clients have confidentiality and counselors and clients have confidentiality  but the two types are different.,97.46,104.213
SPEAKER_01, So I'll explain to you how it will work between you and I but know that is a little bit different  than it works between attorney and their client.,105.08,112.12
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,112.12,112.344
SPEAKER_00, Can you explain the differences to me?,113.48,114.296
SPEAKER_01, Absolutely.,114.684,115.419
, Okay.,115.602,116.051
SPEAKER_01," So you want to think about a counseling relationship all this time you spend here, the notes that  I'll take during the assessment and the progress notes later on because I'll have a chart with  your name on it and it will be stored in a secure place.",116.661,131.192
SPEAKER_01, All that is confidential and next to that word confidential is an asterisk.,132.56,136.997
SPEAKER_01, Right?,138.676,138.839
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,139.166,139.268
SPEAKER_00, There's exceptions.,139.88,140.778
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,140.9,141.064
SPEAKER_01, And what I'm saying to you are those exceptions to confidentiality because confidentiality  isn't absolute.,141.88,147.413
SPEAKER_00, So there's times you might tell someone else something that I said?,148.16,151.317
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,151.8,152.004
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,153.024,153.106
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but there are very specific situations that occur that permit that or mandate that.",153.8,158.379
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,158.825,159.029
SPEAKER_01, And I want to review those with you before we move on.,159.58,161.158
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,161.605,161.911
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,162.36,163.34
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,163.36,163.442
SPEAKER_00, I'd like to know that before I tell you anything.,164.4,165.957
SPEAKER_01, I agree.,166.608,166.833
SPEAKER_01, That's a good way to look at it.,167.2,169.52
SPEAKER_01, So the first exception to confidentiality is when you give me permission to release  information that you've disclosed and interactions we've had in counseling.,169.56,179.519
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,179.781,180.026
SPEAKER_01, This is actually fairly common.,180.882,182.073
SPEAKER_01," For example, do you have a primary care physician?",182.8,184.579
SPEAKER_00," I do, yes.",184.762,185.211
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,185.843,186.068
SPEAKER_01," So depending on what we talk about, you may want him or her to know about our discussions.",186.68,192.48
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,192.929,193.133
SPEAKER_01, And then you would have to sign a release that gives that physician the right to talk  to me directly.,193.48,200.713
SPEAKER_00, That makes sense.,201.444,201.928
SPEAKER_01, All right.,203.223,203.468
SPEAKER_01," Furthermore, your issues with or part of your concern is with your son.",204.12,209.357
SPEAKER_01," So say, and I don't necessarily foresee this, but say later on as we work together, you  want him to come in for a session just to talk about something.",210.44,220.618
SPEAKER_01, Right?,221.733,221.835
SPEAKER_01, And then you would have to sign a release to that confidentiality so he could be here  and talk with me.,222.08,227.511
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,227.96,228.082
SPEAKER_01, Does that make sense?,229.042,229.776
SPEAKER_00, That makes a lot of sense.,229.98,231.495
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,232.797,232.96
SPEAKER_01, The other exceptions are you have an insurance company.,232.98,235.976
SPEAKER_01," So when you fill out your screen packet, insurance companies have access to progress notes, the  assessment, anything on the chart.",236.68,247.411
SPEAKER_01, And they're generally responsible for this information.,249.04,251.04
SPEAKER_01, I don't know of any instances where they're irresponsible with it.,251.12,253.599
SPEAKER_01," But I just think it's important that you know that anything I write in the chart, anything  in the chart itself, technically the insurance company can ask for it.",254.283,261.175
SPEAKER_01, And periodically could review.,262.44,263.554
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,264.917,265.08
SPEAKER_01," Again, I've never seen in my career any difficulty with that.",265.08,268.22
SPEAKER_01," But I just want to let you know that information would be transmitted offsite, so to speak.",268.842,272.436
SPEAKER_01," And when this agency bills, it would be transmitted, your information would be transmitted offsite  to the insurance company.",273.56,280.618
SPEAKER_00," So it goes automatically, whatever progress notes you have automatically go to the insurance  company?",281.42,284.589
SPEAKER_01," The progress notes don't for standard billing, but information about the type of session  we had, the length of the session, and some other personal information about you to identify,  you would go to them.",285.16,295.433
SPEAKER_00," Oh, okay.",295.82,296.065
SPEAKER_01, So they know a service was provided.,296.8,297.718
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,297.922,298.596
SPEAKER_01," But like I said, they're generally very responsible for that information.",298.88,302.075
SPEAKER_01, Large companies have done this for a while.,303.12,304.736
SPEAKER_00, Right.,305.344,305.528
SPEAKER_00," They get all your medical stuff too, so they have it up.",306.12,307.419
SPEAKER_01, They have access to a lot of different types of data.,307.5,309.277
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,310.13,310.334
SPEAKER_01," Another exception to confidentiality, and again, I don't foresee necessarily any of  this happening, but I want to tell you about the limits of it, is in the event that I feel  that you're going to harm, or there's a high potential that you're going to harm yourself  or someone else.",311.701,327.554
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,328.207,328.575
SPEAKER_01, All right.,328.901,329.82
SPEAKER_01," In that instance, I'm obligated to act.",329.84,332.613
SPEAKER_01, Now we're going to probably talk about a lot of different elements of your life through  the next however many weeks we're together.,334.12,340.374
, Okay.,341.609,341.731
SPEAKER_01," When, and if, and again, I don't predict this, you have some sort of suicidal ideation or  you want to harm somebody else.",342.421,351.214
SPEAKER_01," In the unlikely event that happens, I would only release the information I have to release  to protect you or the person that I'm worried about that you might harm.",351.68,360.796
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,361.56,361.825
SPEAKER_01, All right.,363.07,363.438
SPEAKER_01," So if you reveal a lot of like deep, dark secrets, and then you tell me that you want  to go harm a relative of yours, right?",363.56,370.957
SPEAKER_01," I have a duty to warn that relative of what you plan on doing, where you are at the moment,  what threats you've made, but I'm certainly not going to tell them about your deepest  darkest secrets you revealed.",371.48,381.88
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,382.309,382.696
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,382.88,383.023
SPEAKER_01, Unless they're directly relevant to protecting them.,383.88,385.176
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,385.602,385.847
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,386.52,386.806
SPEAKER_01, That's very unlikely they would be.,387.52,388.479
SPEAKER_00," I'm not planning on hurting anybody, but we should be good.",388.903,391.078
SPEAKER_01, I know.,391.442,391.625
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,392.36,392.523
SPEAKER_01," I know that this confidentiality, the information I release, is limited to just what I need  to release.",393.98,400.869
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,402.358,402.44
SPEAKER_01," Similarly, if you have any type of suicidal ideation and I had to contact somebody to  come pick you up, like law enforcement, I would only tell them what I needed to tell  them for them to get you to the hospital and get you in a safe environment.",402.44,415.812
SPEAKER_01," This I want to take an opportunity to talk about the suicidal ideation to let you know  that just because you have suicidal ideation, like thoughts, a lot of people think about  suicide from time to time, or even homicidal ideation or thoughts you're going to harm  someone, not necessarily you're going to kill, but it's harm, does not by any means automatically  mean I'm going to call the police.",417.92,437.711
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,438.807,438.97
SPEAKER_01," Think of it as something that opens a discussion, certainly, about your safety and someone else's  safety, but that's not, we don't go automatically from there, that is, if you have any thoughts,  suicide to the hospital.",439.5,451.828
SPEAKER_01," There's a discussion and many, most, the vast majority actually of people that have suicidal  ideation do not have any intent or plan to commit suicide.",453.28,462.2
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,462.343,462.465
SPEAKER_01, Does that make sense?,463.567,464.159
SPEAKER_00," So you say, so if someone's thinking about it, you are not just going to call the police  and send you to the hospital, you're going to try to get to the bottom of it first.",464.421,471.611
SPEAKER_00, Absolutely.,473.781,474.23
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,474.842,475.047
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,475.74,475.883
SPEAKER_01," That, you know, I have a responsibility to make sure you're safe and I feel like I can  do that if we talk through an issue and you don't have any, you don't have any reason  to believe you're going to harm yourself, but just have a suicidal thought.",476.74,486.478
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,486.943,487.188
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,487.8,487.902
SPEAKER_01," That's a lot different than you came into me and told me about a detailed plan and you  really seem like you're going to do it, then I'd be a lot more worried.",488.82,494.917
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,495.624,495.93
SPEAKER_01, That makes sense.,496.971,497.44
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,497.501,497.685
SPEAKER_01, So that exception of confidentiality is really used in the most extreme cases of suicidal  ideation.,498.46,503.746
SPEAKER_01," Another exception in this state that I want to let you know about is if I have any reason  to believe that a child or an elderly person is being abused, I have to report it.",506.48,518.04
SPEAKER_01, It's called a mandated reporter.,518.261,519.577
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,520.085,520.289
SPEAKER_01, Now I'm sure that you're not abusing and it's older than anyone.,520.84,524.14
SPEAKER_01," No, I'm not abusing anyone.",524.322,525.037
SPEAKER_01, Or elderly people.,525.629,526.139
SPEAKER_01, But I want to explain how this exception works because it's a little more far reaching than  you may think.,526.2,530.845
SPEAKER_01, So say that you come in and you discuss with me a neighbor that seemingly has nothing to  do with your treatment.,532.14,538.916
SPEAKER_01, I just casually mention that something's going on and that discussion leads me to believe  that your neighbor's abusing their child.,539.441,548.135
SPEAKER_01, I still have to report that.,548.901,549.875
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,550.772,550.915
SPEAKER_01," Even though it has really nothing to do with you directly, it's something you just told  me in passing, I'd have to act on it.",551.18,557.815
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,558.684,559.276
SPEAKER_01," And again, I would only release the information necessary to protect that child's safety.",559.5,564.399
, Okay.,565.293,565.374
SPEAKER_01, Does that make sense?,566.211,566.66
SPEAKER_00," It does, yes.",566.66,567.578
SPEAKER_01," So no matter how I find out about it or who it is, I have to act on that.",567.901,573.097
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,574.02,574.204
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,575.061,575.347
SPEAKER_01," And then the last exception I want to review is, again, as with many of these, very unlikely.",576.02,584.498
SPEAKER_01," But if for some reason you're involved in a type of civil or criminal litigation and  a judge orders me to testify, I have to testify.",585.26,596.896
SPEAKER_01," I can tell you this happens very rarely, but it can happen.",598.2,602.135
SPEAKER_01, And I can and will try not to disclose.,603.5,608.239
SPEAKER_01, I'll ask the judge to not disclose if you don't want me to.,608.44,613.038
SPEAKER_01, But ultimately a judge can't order me and I have to.,613.72,616.797
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,617.462,617.727
SPEAKER_01, So in the end it's up to the judge.,618.582,619.693
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,620.707,620.87
SPEAKER_01, I understand that.,621.462,622.36
SPEAKER_01," So again, most of these pretty unlikely.",622.542,624.178
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,624.462,624.646
SPEAKER_01," But I'd rather you have all the information going forward so you don't have any concerns  about where the information you're revealing or talking about, where the information is  going.",625.36,633.227
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,634.635,634.798
SPEAKER_01, Do you have any questions about that?,634.88,635.717
SPEAKER_00, I don't think so.,636.472,636.88
SPEAKER_00, It seems pretty clear.,636.941,637.88
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,637.982,638.268
SPEAKER_01," Well, I appreciate you sitting through that talk on confidentiality.",638.92,642.857
SPEAKER_01, So we're going to get started now with the assessment.,643.54,645.278
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,645.729,645.896
