SPEAKER_01, All right.,165.02,166.244
SPEAKER_01,"Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life,  whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that.",166.264,179.0
SPEAKER_01," So here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people,  like belonging or sense of community, again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality.",180.003,200.82
SPEAKER_01," So when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?",201.662,206.797
SPEAKER_01, I think a sense of community and belonging.,208.843,213.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,213.327,213.612
SPEAKER_01, I think those two and respect.,214.04,217.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,218.382,219.166
SPEAKER_01,Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?,219.206,221.879
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, well, I think community and belonging, I kind of related them.",222.723,225.896
SPEAKER_01, You know how I said I was in the marching band.,227.646,229.0
SPEAKER_01," I really, you know, I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working together towards that one goal.",229.12,238.198
SPEAKER_01," And then in terms of respect, I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules.",239.341,245.98
SPEAKER_01, Like I really do think respect is important to respect myself and respect those around me.,246.12,250.839
SPEAKER_01, So I place great importance in that.,251.02,253.758
SPEAKER_01," Okay, great.",254.06,254.781
SPEAKER_01,"So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging, like you said, and sort of a sense of purpose in a way.",254.842,264.76
SPEAKER_01," And then the respect is really sort of all encompassing, not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you.",265.24,275.8
SPEAKER_00," Okay, that's great.",276.041,276.918
SPEAKER_01, All right.,277.602,277.943
SPEAKER_01,"Well, one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends.",278.023,283.0
SPEAKER_01, So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?,283.844,287.0
SPEAKER_01," Sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go to the beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some board games and hang out.",288.223,295.98
SPEAKER_01," And when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?",297.447,299.96
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, sometimes.",300.0,300.959
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,301.281,302.485
SPEAKER_01,Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?,302.645,306.88
SPEAKER_01," Well, it's mostly just for parties or party settings.",308.102,312.471
SPEAKER_01,"It's kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up, as they say.",312.551,316.8
SPEAKER_01," And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there.",318.005,321.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,321.041,321.184
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,322.121,322.804
SPEAKER_01,And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?,322.824,325.377
SPEAKER_01," I'd say on a not busy month, for instance.",326.1,329.99
SPEAKER_01,"I'd say about like two weekends out of the month, two or three.",330.09,333.599
SPEAKER_01, So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not.,334.723,338.498
SPEAKER_01, Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?,339.04,343.538
SPEAKER_01," The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties.",344.2,347.347
SPEAKER_01,"So it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun.",347.988,353.699
SPEAKER_01," And then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed.",354.1,355.825
SPEAKER_01,"It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie.",355.905,359.556
SPEAKER_01,"It's not, yeah.",359.676,360.86
SPEAKER_01," So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is going to be there.",361.201,365.0
SPEAKER_01, Definitely.,365.02,365.245
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,366.341,366.461
SPEAKER_01,"And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at, say, a party versus the night you're playing board games?",366.481,375.519
SPEAKER_01, I think of them as different.,376.341,378.186
SPEAKER_01,"I think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing.",378.206,382.88
SPEAKER_01, So it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic.,383.241,388.673
SPEAKER_01,After it all it's very draining.,389.695,391.479
SPEAKER_01, But in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have fun.,392.302,395.377
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,396.0,396.141
SPEAKER_01,So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides.,396.343,397.96
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,398.02,398.245
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,399.0,399.281
SPEAKER_01,What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?,399.724,402.799
SPEAKER_01," It's, you know, when we drink we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together.",403.882,412.016
SPEAKER_01,We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed.,412.056,413.719
SPEAKER_01, And not really thinking about stresses or things like that.,414.281,417.678
SPEAKER_01," But it can be, when it's too much drinking, it can be obviously bad.",418.622,424.657
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,426.082,426.286
SPEAKER_01," So sort of in the too much drinking or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?",427.602,434.92
SPEAKER_01, A lot of times it will make people stupid.,435.962,439.811
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that.",439.831,444.0
SPEAKER_01, We usually try to be as safe about it as possible.,444.822,448.591
SPEAKER_01,So we'll like sleep over a friend's house and so that we're not driving.,448.652,452.0
SPEAKER_01, And it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.,452.02,458.679
SPEAKER_01, But definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're drunk can be really stupid.,459.421,465.599
SPEAKER_01," So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities.",466.521,471.311
SPEAKER_01,You're trying to stay put.,471.331,472.453
SPEAKER_01,You're not driving.,472.473,473.535
SPEAKER_01,You're trying to stay with people that you trust.,473.575,475.84
SPEAKER_01," But yeah, it sounds like there's still some things happening from time to time.",476.905,479.899
SPEAKER_00," Sometimes, yeah.",480.061,480.612
SPEAKER_01, Can you tell me a little bit about that?,481.283,482.939
SPEAKER_01," Well, I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that.",483.441,490.98
SPEAKER_01," That, I don't, that's not fun.",491.141,492.879
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, throwing up is never fun.",493.02,494.03
SPEAKER_01, It's not.,495.0,495.245
SPEAKER_01, And how often do you think that happens?,496.707,498.0
SPEAKER_01," For me, that's happened to me once.",498.742,500.207
SPEAKER_01,It was the first time I ever drank and it was a lot.,500.428,502.656
SPEAKER_01,I didn't know what I was doing.,502.696,503.96
SPEAKER_01, I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything anyone gave me.,504.602,509.855
SPEAKER_01,That didn't end well.,510.496,511.88
SPEAKER_01," But after that, I haven't, but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something.",512.301,519.779
SPEAKER_01, It kind of puts it down around my fun.,520.884,522.794
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,524.701,525.042
SPEAKER_01,"So on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sort of carefree, can kind of let loose a little bit more.",525.082,536.0
SPEAKER_01," But on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can.",536.321,545.559
SPEAKER_01," And then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck, your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drank too much.",546.24,557.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,557.643,557.925
SPEAKER_01,Any other not so good things about the alcohol?,558.025,560.417
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, people can get a little sloppy, I guess.",561.0,564.506
SPEAKER_01,They're all loose with people in corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff.,564.566,572.86
SPEAKER_01, So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.,573.221,576.457
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,577.0,577.347
SPEAKER_01, Got it.,578.0,578.301
SPEAKER_01,Okay.,578.922,579.082
SPEAKER_01,All right.,579.383,579.643
SPEAKER_01,"Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking.",579.683,587.76
SPEAKER_01, Why did you make those decisions?,588.0,589.354
SPEAKER_01," I just, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic, so I see the issues that are involved in movies and things.",590.16,598.399
SPEAKER_01, I know that junk driving is an issue.,599.24,600.923
SPEAKER_01,"So I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where we can let loose but still be safe, like at someone's house or someone's parent's home or something.",601.484,612.72
SPEAKER_01, So I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun.,614.424,619.92
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,621.0,621.982
SPEAKER_01,It sounds kind of similar to your value of respect too.,622.242,626.108
SPEAKER_01,"So on the one hand, the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.",626.268,632.458
SPEAKER_01,"If there's too much, then it sort of…  Then it kind of defeats the purpose.",632.878,635.859
SPEAKER_00, Right.,636.0,636.28
SPEAKER_01,"And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.",636.821,645.054
SPEAKER_01,How do you think that the drinking fits in with that?,646.296,648.559
SPEAKER_01, In terms of what?,649.621,650.302
SPEAKER_01,In terms of respect?,650.342,651.324
SPEAKER_01,"I think, well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things, I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there.",652.205,661.7
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,662.041,662.653
SPEAKER_01," And then, but in terms of ways I am respecting myself, I am respecting myself by trying to stay in someone's house and trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out, throwing up and everything.",663.0,677.98
SPEAKER_01," And try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met into I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that.",678.3,691.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,691.16,691.561
SPEAKER_01,So you're sort of looking for that balance of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but not crossover.,692.523,700.88
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,701.281,701.582
SPEAKER_01,And what have you come up with at this point?,702.845,704.971
SPEAKER_01,Do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or are you?,705.011,707.96
SPEAKER_01," I usually, well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink.",708.281,717.0
SPEAKER_01," So I'll usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like alright this is my one drink and I'm good.",717.641,729.98
SPEAKER_01, And that way I still have something in my cup so people aren't going to be like oh here I have some more.,730.0,733.909
SPEAKER_01,"I'll be like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little.",733.929,739.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,739.08,739.281
SPEAKER_01,And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or what do you think?,741.346,746.98
SPEAKER_01," For the most part it works pretty well because like I said people, you know, if people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have, you know, I still have some like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything.",747.341,757.94
SPEAKER_01," But sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start, you know, falling into the too much.",758.24,773.66
SPEAKER_01, So a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you'd like to make some adjustments to make it a little smoother.,774.361,784.96
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,785.461,785.781
SPEAKER_01,So kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself?,786.202,796.96
SPEAKER_01," I'd like to make sure that I, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body I'd like to, you know, try to drink less.",798.323,806.659
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,807.367,807.592
SPEAKER_01," Like I, you know, it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body and I'm like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22.",808.0,817.479
SPEAKER_01," And, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group, as a community.",819.183,826.84
SPEAKER_01, Uh huh.,827.161,828.128
SPEAKER_01,So kind of combining those goals.,828.148,830.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,830.02,830.143
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,831.0,831.2
SPEAKER_01,So you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking.,831.24,835.987
SPEAKER_01,How important is it to you to work on that goal on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right now?,836.428,844.7
SPEAKER_01, I'd say about like a six or a seven.,845.161,847.94
SPEAKER_00, Oh okay.,848.286,848.571
SPEAKER_01," I'd like to work on it but, you know, if I get around to it I get around to it.",849.0,852.015
SPEAKER_01,If I don't I don't.,852.035,852.598
SPEAKER_01, Uh huh.,853.0,853.181
SPEAKER_01,Well why'd you say six or seven rather than like a four?,853.322,855.874
SPEAKER_01, Because I still think it's important.,857.543,860.497
SPEAKER_01, Uh huh.,861.347,861.653
SPEAKER_01," I still, you know, like I said I don't want my body to, especially going to med school, like I know how things affect your body and also affect your social and your school work and things like that.",862.0,872.0
SPEAKER_01," I know that once I get to college it's not, it's not gonna work out, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam.",872.22,884.956
SPEAKER_01,I know that's not feasible.,885.056,887.359
SPEAKER_01,It's not a good idea.,887.419,888.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.",888.02,893.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,893.0,893.122
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,894.02,894.121
SPEAKER_01,Well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to?,894.623,897.94
SPEAKER_01, I think.,898.0,898.163
