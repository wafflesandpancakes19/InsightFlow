SPEAKER_01," I got a call this morning from your family doctor, because I think you went to see him  this morning along with your mum, and I gather that things have been a little bit difficult  for you, you've had some other distressing experiences, so I think your doctor thought  it might be helpful for us to have a bit of a discussion about that, to see if I could  help.",22.52,36.943

SPEAKER_00," Well, I thought about getting some pills, but I couldn't leave the house, so I didn't get anything.",421.301,431.74

SPEAKER_00, OK.,600.8,600.9
SPEAKER_01,"I guess the reason I was checking, I think is what you've picked up on, is that sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are, they find if they take certain drugs it can make things feel a lot worse.",601.702,610.78
SPEAKER_01, I just wanted to check if that hadn't been your experience.,611.081,613.936

SPEAKER_01, I just wanted to check with you.,625.92,630.087
SPEAKER_01,Do you think it could be due to anything else?,630.147,631.91
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be actually mentally unwell.",632.151,637.8

SPEAKER_01, Meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful.,671.161,677.76
