SPEAKER_00," Hi, Alvina.",0.322,1.006
SPEAKER_00,How are you doing today?,1.569,2.414
SPEAKER_00,It's good to see you.,2.434,3.098
SPEAKER_01, I'm just tired.,3.642,4.432
SPEAKER_00, Just tired.,5.224,5.796
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,6.041,6.327
SPEAKER_00," You know, we did some pre-visit planning with you, and your PHQ-2, which is a short depression screen, was actually positive.",7.0,18.0
SPEAKER_00," So we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool, which is a PHQ-9.",18.161,22.858
SPEAKER_00," And that actually did come up with a score of 8, which is in the mild depression range.",23.821,30.398
SPEAKER_00, So how does that feel?,31.281,33.03
SPEAKER_01," Well, I knew I felt different.",35.522,37.912
SPEAKER_01,I didn't know I was depressed.,38.193,39.679
SPEAKER_00, But you knew something was wrong.,40.423,42.416
SPEAKER_01, I didn't feel like myself.,43.08,44.286
SPEAKER_01,"I haven't been feeling like myself, no.",44.307,46.558
SPEAKER_00, Tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself.,47.281,49.814
SPEAKER_01," Well, you know, I just go to work, and I come home, and I sleep.",51.121,54.698
SPEAKER_01," I wake up in the morning, and I'm still tired.",55.422,57.653
SPEAKER_01, I just have no energy.,59.323,60.976
SPEAKER_00," So you sleep a lot, but even though you're sleeping, you don't wake up rested.",61.922,65.739
SPEAKER_01," No, not at all.",66.102,66.939
SPEAKER_00, Doesn't sound like good quality sleep.,67.384,68.838
SPEAKER_01, No.,69.364,69.566
SPEAKER_01, I just have no energy.,71.241,72.266
SPEAKER_01,I don't want to do anything but just sleep.,72.286,74.136
SPEAKER_00, How long has that been going on?,75.162,76.236
SPEAKER_01, Hmm.,76.641,76.883
SPEAKER_01,I guess a couple months.,77.629,78.597
SPEAKER_00, Two or three months.,79.449,80.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,80.408,80.612
SPEAKER_00," What else is going on, Albina?",81.866,83.094
SPEAKER_01," Well, you know, I've been drinking more.",84.985,87.94
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I drink socially, but I find myself that when I come home, you know, I have a glass of wine, and then I just go to sleep.",88.361,96.359
SPEAKER_00, And that's worrisome to you?,97.545,98.657
SPEAKER_01," It is, because I don't usually drink that often during the week.",99.161,102.437
SPEAKER_01, So it's increased.,103.201,104.849
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,106.779,107.0
SPEAKER_00, I can see where that would be.,107.929,108.818
SPEAKER_00, Bothersome to you.,110.152,110.96
SPEAKER_00, What else is going on with you?,112.106,114.256
SPEAKER_01," Well, you know, my mom died a year ago, so Mother's Day is coming up.",116.384,121.9
SPEAKER_01," So, you know, I've been thinking about mom a lot.",122.06,124.131
SPEAKER_01,I miss her a lot.,124.251,126.0
SPEAKER_00, That anniversary is close.,126.362,128.94
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,129.612,129.816
SPEAKER_00," Well, that's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents.",131.04,137.92
SPEAKER_00, That's a very difficult time.,138.0,139.515
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,141.286,141.93
SPEAKER_01,And I took care of mom.,142.975,143.98
SPEAKER_01," So that's hard, because for a long time, well, she was sick and she died from cancer, so I took care of her.",144.622,150.98
SPEAKER_01," So for a long time, that's all I did was take care of mom and work.",151.161,153.98
SPEAKER_01," So now that she's gone, it just kind of brings up everything all over again.",155.225,158.679
SPEAKER_00, There's kind of a hole in your life.,159.182,160.556
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,161.121,161.465
SPEAKER_01,We were really close.,161.626,162.556
SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm really sorry for your loss, and thank you for sharing that with me.",164.401,168.573
SPEAKER_00,I know that's very difficult.,168.613,170.799
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected.,172.562,177.275
SPEAKER_00,You're not getting good quality sleep.,177.516,179.0
SPEAKER_00, You're really fatigued.,180.832,181.879
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,182.204,182.469
SPEAKER_00," Just kind of going through the motions, it sounds like, during the day.",183.242,185.718
SPEAKER_00," And then, how's your appetite been?",187.623,190.377
SPEAKER_01, Not really eating that much.,192.784,194.111
SPEAKER_01,"You know, because I don't have energy.",194.814,195.96
SPEAKER_01," You know, before I would come home, cook dinner, or, you know, meet some friends after work.",196.12,201.0
SPEAKER_01, But I don't want to do that.,201.261,202.223
SPEAKER_01,I just come home and have a glass of wine and just go to bed.,202.324,207.639
SPEAKER_00, So you used to be more socially involved than you are now.,208.221,210.96
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I don't do anything now.",211.141,213.0
SPEAKER_00, A little more isolated.,213.0,214.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, just work and come home and sleep.",214.06,217.0
SPEAKER_00," So, if there was something that you could do about this, what do you think you might like to do?",218.002,225.86
SPEAKER_01," Well, I don't want to stay like this.",226.883,228.247
SPEAKER_01,"This isn't who I am, you know, just sleeping all the time.",228.95,231.98
SPEAKER_01," It's just, I don't want to stay this way.",232.0,233.939
SPEAKER_00, It kind of feels like you're stuck at this point.,234.081,237.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I just don't want to do anything or go out with my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep.",237.782,244.0
SPEAKER_01, I don't want to do that.,244.0,244.626
SPEAKER_00, It's kind of the same old routine.,246.808,248.0
SPEAKER_00, I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression.,252.243,259.94
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,260.02,260.163
SPEAKER_00, Would that be all right?,261.265,261.959
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,262.082,262.286
SPEAKER_00," Most of the time, we typically think about medication as a possible answer.",264.602,269.498
SPEAKER_00, Mm.,270.0,270.041
SPEAKER_00," So, no medication at this point.",272.687,274.0
SPEAKER_00, I don't want any medication.,274.061,275.798
SPEAKER_01,No.,275.818,275.859
SPEAKER_01, All right.,276.408,276.857
SPEAKER_00," Then, I think as important, certainly, perhaps more important than medication is counseling  and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that.",279.622,292.98
SPEAKER_01, I'm okay with that.,293.501,294.404
SPEAKER_01,"You know, when Mom was sick, she was in hospice care, so she had cancer.",294.464,299.278
SPEAKER_01," And the nurses and the doctors had our family talk to someone about what we were feeling, what we had to face.",300.221,308.0
SPEAKER_00, So that was a pretty good experience?,308.0,309.838
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,310.545,310.869
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,311.818,311.98
SPEAKER_01, To talk to someone that understood what we were going through.,313.283,315.0
SPEAKER_01, Sure.,315.041,315.143
SPEAKER_00, Something else might be exercise.,319.104,322.036
SPEAKER_00, Another possibility would be a natural product.,323.944,327.98
SPEAKER_00, There are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate.,328.0,333.0
SPEAKER_00, And that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those.,333.221,338.0
SPEAKER_01, Maybe something natural.,338.624,339.631
SPEAKER_01,Exercise.,339.732,340.356
SPEAKER_01, I don't have energy.,341.263,342.131
SPEAKER_01,I don't want to...,342.152,342.879
SPEAKER_01," I just don't feel like doing anything, so I know I'm not going to exercise right now.",343.764,346.819
SPEAKER_01," But if it's something that's natural, you know, I could maybe try that.",347.523,350.92
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,351.633,351.959
SPEAKER_00," If it's okay, let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute, and then we can hit some of those other things too.",354.381,360.679
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,361.122,361.49
SPEAKER_00," So, is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with?",362.0,368.96
SPEAKER_00," This lady that worked with you during your mom's death, is she...",369.403,372.0
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,372.02,372.184
SPEAKER_00, Someone that's out in the community?,373.082,374.0
SPEAKER_01, She was really nice from... Yeah.,374.282,375.691
SPEAKER_01,I liked her.,375.732,376.96
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that.,379.462,383.98
SPEAKER_00," Could you say on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being really ready, 0 being not ready at all, how ready would you be to do some counseling?",385.442,395.86
SPEAKER_01, Maybe like a 6 or a 7.,397.329,398.597
SPEAKER_00, So a 6 or a 7.,400.743,401.305
SPEAKER_00,Why a 6 or a 7 and not a 4 or a 5?,401.365,403.293
SPEAKER_01," Well, because I don't want to stay like this, and you know, I've already talked to her before.",406.525,410.518
SPEAKER_01," She was really nice, so I wouldn't mind going back to her, and she told me, you know, when I saw her last time, if ever needed, I could come back.",412.083,419.0
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you've got a connection there already.,419.0,422.0
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,422.02,422.102
SPEAKER_00, That's really good.,423.102,423.796
, Yeah.,424.0,424.082
SPEAKER_00, Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?,428.587,434.86
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,435.482,435.803
SPEAKER_01,I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again.,435.823,440.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,440.02,440.204
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,441.306,441.592
SPEAKER_00," Well, if that's okay then, would it be alright if we talked a little bit about the exercise?",442.523,446.0
SPEAKER_00," I know you said it didn't really sound like an option for you at this time, and that's perfectly fine.",446.241,451.98
SPEAKER_00, Perfectly fine.,452.161,452.826
SPEAKER_00,"Only you can make those decisions, Alvena.",452.866,454.658
SPEAKER_00," But if it's okay, I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain.",456.484,461.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,462.592,462.918
SPEAKER_00," Exercise is, again, in a number of studies, has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants.",464.463,471.96
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,472.566,472.646
SPEAKER_01,I didn't know that.,472.667,473.919
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,474.764,475.045
SPEAKER_00,It actually raises serotonin.,475.146,476.673
SPEAKER_00,Have you heard about serotonin?,476.693,478.0
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I have.",478.0,478.429
SPEAKER_01, It's kind of a happy hormone.,479.02,479.898
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,480.041,480.143
SPEAKER_00," So it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF, which is, well, it doesn't really matter what it is,  but it helps actually your brain actually grow and help repair itself.",481.842,494.0
SPEAKER_00," So exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress, certainly,  and then actually improving the quality of sleep.",494.942,505.41
SPEAKER_00,How does that sound at this point?,506.693,508.438
SPEAKER_01," Well, if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again, does that mean I don't have to go on the medication?",509.782,516.779
SPEAKER_01," Right now, we can try that?",517.949,519.0
SPEAKER_00, Absolutely.,520.043,520.605
SPEAKER_00,"Again, those are your decisions, and I'm here to really support you in those.",520.806,524.98
SPEAKER_00," So if those sound like things that you might be willing to do, I'm all for it.",525.302,528.96
SPEAKER_01," Well, I'll try that if I don't have to go on the medication.",529.364,531.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,531.061,531.367
SPEAKER_01, I have some friends that exercise and work out that I could probably call and exercise with them.,533.224,537.86
SPEAKER_00, So you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program.,538.846,541.0
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,541.02,541.245
SPEAKER_00, Is that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group?,544.127,548.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I have friends that run and friends that go to the gym.",548.06,552.214
SPEAKER_01,I have some friends that walk after work.,552.254,554.0
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do.,555.124,560.0
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,560.143,560.49
SPEAKER_00, Which of those tend to interest you most?,561.343,563.0
SPEAKER_01," Well, then also, you know, my church on the weekends, they have exercise classes too.",564.321,568.92
SPEAKER_01," So, yeah, but I think, I guess I don't have energy really to exercise, but I'll try it.",569.221,576.0
SPEAKER_01," But I'll definitely call the person I had talked to when mom passed away, and I'll do that right away.",576.381,581.759
SPEAKER_00, Very good.,582.102,582.653
SPEAKER_00," Well, I think it sounds like this is important for you to feel better, and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan.",584.22,595.479
SPEAKER_00, How do you see this fitting into your life at this point?,597.023,602.0
SPEAKER_00," Again, kind of getting back to the counseling and the exercise.",604.045,609.599
SPEAKER_01," Well, when I saw her, I could see her after work.",610.782,614.168
SPEAKER_01,So I can call her and see if I can still see her after work for therapy.,614.549,619.82
SPEAKER_01," And exercise, I mean, I can do that, you know, after work or on the weekends.",620.721,625.711
SPEAKER_01,"My friends, they exercise various times.",625.832,628.537
SPEAKER_01,"So, yeah.",628.717,629.419
SPEAKER_00, Let's talk a little bit more about that.,630.882,632.827
SPEAKER_00,"Let's say on a scale of, if we can use another one of those scales,  zero being confident that you could start an exercise program, zero being not very confident at all, and ten being very confident.",632.847,650.0
SPEAKER_00, Tell me where you are in this exercise thing.,650.724,653.879
SPEAKER_01," Honestly, maybe a five.",657.584,659.367
SPEAKER_01,I'll try it.,661.932,662.753
SPEAKER_01,"Anything, if I have to do that so I don't have to go on medication, then I'll try it.",663.314,667.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,667.322,668.688
SPEAKER_00,That sounds like a pretty strong commitment.,669.854,671.0
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I'll try it.",671.566,672.434
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,673.321,673.723
SPEAKER_00,And tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point then.,674.225,677.98
SPEAKER_01," Well, you know, my friends have been calling, but, you know, I'm just sleeping all the time.",679.442,683.036
SPEAKER_01,"So when they call, I'm asleep.",683.096,683.92
SPEAKER_01, So I haven't really called them back.,684.481,685.824
SPEAKER_01,"But, you know, I can just return their calls and just let them know I'll want to meet up with them and, you know, at least maybe just start walking.",685.844,693.96
SPEAKER_00, I think that's a great decision.,694.462,696.269
SPEAKER_00,You have a couple of friends in mind that you could call?,696.59,698.94
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I have real close friends that live not too far from me.",699.883,703.997
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,704.017,704.9
SPEAKER_00, So tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with the exercise.,705.16,713.419
SPEAKER_01," Well, I probably shouldn't come home.",715.861,718.444
SPEAKER_01,I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friend's house after work and change with her.,719.325,731.379
SPEAKER_00, It would be difficult to do it in the morning.,732.0,734.271
SPEAKER_00,You don't see that happening.,734.412,735.397
SPEAKER_01," No, because it's so hard when I get up in the morning.",736.02,737.826
SPEAKER_01,I'm so tired that I can't see doing it in the morning.,737.846,741.378
SPEAKER_00, And you think it would be easier to do it after work?,742.0,744.477
SPEAKER_01, Because I'm already out.,745.0,745.925
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, as long as I don't come home.",746.065,747.472
SPEAKER_01,So I come home and want to go to sleep.,747.533,748.94
SPEAKER_00," Come home, it's over.",749.061,750.758
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,751.081,751.242
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,751.303,751.424
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,753.0,753.34
SPEAKER_00,"Well, good.",755.183,755.664
SPEAKER_00,It sounds like we have a plan for the counselor.,756.966,760.771
SPEAKER_00,"And when you check out today, I will put this in your record.",761.192,766.599
SPEAKER_00, And we'll want to get in touch with the counselor that you worked with when your mom was going through her passing and the grief situation.,767.501,777.74
SPEAKER_00, And then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program.,778.361,786.9
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,787.101,787.364
SPEAKER_01,I'll try that.,787.828,788.657
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,789.421,789.802
SPEAKER_00,"And if it's okay, I'd like to call you in a week to one, see how you're feeling and two, if the exercise is helping.",789.882,798.0
SPEAKER_00," You may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial, you may actually look forward to it.",798.201,805.0
SPEAKER_00, Because my hope is that it will actually help you feel better and improve your mood.,805.903,811.719
SPEAKER_00, And then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things.,813.225,817.0
SPEAKER_00," Now, we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point.",817.381,822.095
SPEAKER_00," But I want you to know, you can call anytime and I will work to get you in.",824.742,830.0
SPEAKER_00, And that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working.,831.181,837.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,837.525,837.925
