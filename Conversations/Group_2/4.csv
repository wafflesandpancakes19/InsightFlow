SPEAKER_00, I'm doing well.,17.22,17.682
SPEAKER_00,Thanks for asking.,17.722,18.424
SPEAKER_00,I understand you had some symptoms recently that have been  bothering you.,19.528,23.629
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,24.16,24.344
SPEAKER_00, Could you tell me about those?,25.242,26.038
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, I have this position at  work where I have to make these weekly presentations and it's killing me.",26.681,39.214
SPEAKER_01,I can't do it anymore.,39.515,40.316
SPEAKER_00, Tell me about how these presentations are set up.,41.96,43.774
SPEAKER_01, So it's the executive director and it's ten managers and we're kind of sitting in a circle  and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update.,44.841,55.394
SPEAKER_01,"Five minutes or so,  maybe ten at the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be discussed.",55.895,60.515
SPEAKER_01,"But everybody  takes turns speaking and it goes around, kind of around in a circle.",61.238,66.111
SPEAKER_01,And depending on where  you sit is what order you present in basically.,67.434,72.659
SPEAKER_00, All right.,74.125,74.386
SPEAKER_00,"And you say that this situation with the presentation, you said it's killing  you.",74.487,78.084
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,78.941,79.064
SPEAKER_00, What do you have in it?,80.0,80.857
SPEAKER_01, I feel like it's constantly on my mind.,81.04,84.031
SPEAKER_01,"I'm constantly worried about this presentation  and even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I'm so consumed by this part  of my job that I can't do anything else.",84.071,97.85
SPEAKER_01,"And I normally, I feel like I do good in my job  but this.",97.93,102.924
SPEAKER_01,And it builds up more like every day.,102.944,107.514
SPEAKER_01,The day before is really bad because  I'm prepping for the meeting and so it really starts to consume me then.,107.534,115.077
SPEAKER_01,"I don't sleep the  night before and then by the time I get to the meeting, I'm so anxious and so nervous.",115.097,124.559
SPEAKER_01, I'm panicking.,125.303,126.119
SPEAKER_01, You're panicking.,126.16,126.589
SPEAKER_01, And I just can't.,127.561,128.587
SPEAKER_01,I just can't.,128.607,129.109
SPEAKER_00, So this is distressing for you.,132.661,134.98
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,135.33,135.495
SPEAKER_00, And this is probably difficult to talk about.,135.921,140.732
SPEAKER_00,"At the beginning of the meeting, what would  be your anxiety level?",141.814,145.452
SPEAKER_00,What's going on then?,145.473,146.08
SPEAKER_01," By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I feel like I'm breathing harder.",147.361,153.0
SPEAKER_01, I'm starting to sweat and I feel like my face is turning red.,154.021,158.576
SPEAKER_01,My palms are really sweaty.,158.616,159.7
SPEAKER_01, I'm constantly having to wipe them off on my pants.,159.8,162.847
SPEAKER_01,"My heart is racing and I feel like,  you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse.",163.989,174.599
SPEAKER_01,I feel  like I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder.,174.64,177.994
SPEAKER_01,I feel like everybody can hear  it.,178.015,179.521
SPEAKER_01,My stomach just gets in knots.,181.004,182.788
SPEAKER_01,I feel nauseous.,183.429,184.371
SPEAKER_01,There have been times that I've  managed to just hold my hands still and just sit really still and I've tried some deep breathing  and just sat and have made it through and have made it to my presentation and been able to speak.,184.391,204.96
SPEAKER_01," But even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words and I don't say everything  I need to even though I have a cheat sheet essentially and I can read from it.",205.221,218.179
SPEAKER_01,I still  feel like I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out.,218.199,221.107
SPEAKER_01,"My voice doesn't project so I end  up speaking very softly and like I said, I'm stuttering.",222.51,229.789
SPEAKER_01,"I just can't get it even then, but  it's still, I feel like it's still a mess.",229.809,236.226
SPEAKER_00,So you're not happy with the quality of your  presentation?,237.27,240.402
SPEAKER_00,No.,240.422,240.462
SPEAKER_00,Even when you're able to kind of stay there and conduct it.,240.964,245.156
SPEAKER_00,So I want to divide  this into the stages.,245.718,249.23
SPEAKER_00,So we talked about the very beginning.,249.27,250.554
SPEAKER_00,So you're already having anxiety.,250.815,251.999
SPEAKER_00,It  sounds like it's fairly intense at that point.,252.019,254.386
SPEAKER_00,"Tell me about as they go around the table and  give their brief presentations, tell me about what you're feeling as the presentations come  around to you.",255.068,268.962
SPEAKER_01,"Well, if I manage somehow to get there early enough and I can get an early enough  seat like to sit like right next to my boss or like one or two away, then I'm actually pretty  okay because I can kind of get it over and done.",269.986,282.848
SPEAKER_01,But so many times I'm so nervous and honestly  a bit hungover because I've been drinking to try and I don't feel anxious when I drink.,283.629,294.76
SPEAKER_01," So there have been a lot of times that I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking  and so by the time I get there, I'm like one of the last, it's one of the last seats,  so I'm one of the last to go.",295.981,308.083
SPEAKER_01,"And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more  anxious and panicky and here in the, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave.",310.249,323.099
SPEAKER_01,I can  stay.,323.279,324.041
SPEAKER_00,I've had to go.,324.282,325.405
SPEAKER_00,"So before the presentations come around to you, you get up and leave the room.",325.425,330.92
SPEAKER_00," So in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation,  so the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, the sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing  as they go around the table or the room.",332.404,349.928
SPEAKER_00,"And when it comes to you actually giving your presentation,  you're not happy with it, but what's your anxiety level like during your presentation?",350.57,359.32
SPEAKER_01," I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything,  it's like everything stops and then when it's done and it goes to whoever's next,  it's like, it's almost like a physical sense of relief, like, okay, that's over and everything  starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable.",360.561,390.771
SPEAKER_01,"I am so, so upset with how I performed  that more than anybody else that, well, really that everybody is like, what is wrong with her,  but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again?",390.792,407.793
SPEAKER_01,"And I feel so,  so miserable that I feel like I've disappointed him and so I've disappointed me.",407.813,419.917
SPEAKER_01,"And I mean,  this has always, always happened to me for as long as I can remember.",419.937,427.778
SPEAKER_01,I've never been able to  speak in front of groups.,427.798,430.404
SPEAKER_01,"And from back in college, if I had to make a presentation,  I would ask the teacher if there was a way out of it.",430.966,441.409
SPEAKER_01,"And if they refused, then I wouldn't present.",442.633,445.0
SPEAKER_01, And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation and I dropped the class and I took  it again with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it.,447.101,459.358
SPEAKER_01,"And  high school was the same, that I would, you know, I just wouldn't do it.",459.379,465.514
SPEAKER_01,"And actually,  this is ridiculous.",465.795,469.764
SPEAKER_01,"You know, I mentioned drinking.",469.784,471.952
SPEAKER_01,I've been drinking for a really long time.,472.112,473.718
SPEAKER_01,"And  when I was like, I don't know, like 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do  some like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and  I couldn't do that.",473.738,493.402
SPEAKER_01,I bolted out of the room.,493.422,496.069
SPEAKER_01,"And so I've never been able to do this, ever.",496.089,500.6
SPEAKER_00, So you've had these symptoms for a long time.,502.081,503.892
SPEAKER_00,They've been frustrating you for a long time.,503.912,505.32
SPEAKER_00, How about periods of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people?,507.141,510.5
SPEAKER_01," Well, if I haven't had to be in front of other people, I've been kind of okay.",512.663,518.356
SPEAKER_01,"You know,  I can go to the movies, but I like to sit on the end.",518.416,522.667
SPEAKER_01,"You know, I can go out with my family  and my friends and we can go shopping, but I don't like to go to new places.",522.688,533.018
SPEAKER_01,I like to go  kind of like the same places that I've been.,533.098,536.268
SPEAKER_01,Familiar with them.,536.529,537.373
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, yeah.",537.413,537.714
SPEAKER_01,Because then I  know them.,537.734,539.542
SPEAKER_01,"You know, I know the layout of stores and things like that.",539.582,542.231
SPEAKER_00,"All right, so it interferes  with your functioning maybe a little bit, but if you're not having to present, it's not as big a  deal as it is now for you with this job.",542.251,552.445
SPEAKER_00,This is really affecting you.,553.187,554.249
SPEAKER_00,So are you taking any  measures or have you taken any measures other than the drinking you mentioned to avoid the situation?,555.713,567.54
SPEAKER_01," Oh, definitely.",567.761,569.61
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, there's, like I said, I mean, I've run out of the meetings.",569.69,571.68
SPEAKER_01, There's been times that I've called in sick when I haven't been.,572.761,575.913
SPEAKER_01,"There's been times when I've said  I've had car trouble, arrived so late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation.",575.954,583.879
SPEAKER_01, I've actually talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my notes to  him or to brief him before or after.,584.52,594.93
SPEAKER_01,Because I don't want to say that I have this problem.,595.892,598.999
SPEAKER_01,"I mean,  normal people don't do this, right?",599.019,601.87
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, normal people can make these presentations.",601.89,603.819
SPEAKER_01,"I mean,  the rest of the staff can do it.",603.839,605.506
SPEAKER_01,Why can't I?,605.546,606.409
SPEAKER_01,"And so I don't want to tell him that, you know,  that there's something wrong with me.",607.212,612.146
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, it's gotten to the point that I've talked to him about,  you know, this other position that's in another department and transferring so that I won't have  to do this anymore.",612.166,624.003
SPEAKER_01,And it would be a pay cut.,624.023,626.429
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, it's a demotion.",626.469,627.311
SPEAKER_01,But I can't live like this.,627.391,631.0
SPEAKER_00, This is too painful.,631.761,633.165
SPEAKER_00,"If you had the other job, this other job would involve presentations.",634.168,637.82
SPEAKER_00, So you'd be happier.,639.18,641.829
SPEAKER_00,You'd have fewer symptoms in that job.,642.751,645.42
SPEAKER_00, What's been the result of that discussion?,648.004,649.89
SPEAKER_00,Has there been anything that's happened as far as?,649.931,652.279
SPEAKER_01," Well, he's told me that he thinks I'm doing a good job.",652.76,660.58
SPEAKER_01, Excuse me.,665.22,665.621
SPEAKER_01,And he doesn't want me to change positions.,665.641,667.404
SPEAKER_01,But I can't do this anymore.,667.424,668.486
SPEAKER_00, All right.,678.162,678.643
SPEAKER_00,So you've tried to cope with anxiety.,678.663,681.948
SPEAKER_00,"You've had to leave, call in sick or come in late.",681.968,688.519
SPEAKER_00, You've looked for a different position where it doesn't involve presenting.,690.14,694.894
SPEAKER_00,"You've had this  problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations before.",694.914,704.38
SPEAKER_00, Do you or have you seen any symptoms like this in your parents?,706.841,711.54
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually.",712.681,715.88
SPEAKER_01, We would kind of joke about it sometimes that we all get so nervous.,718.741,722.04
SPEAKER_01," And my sister, I don't know how, but she managed to find a job where she doesn't interact with  anybody.",724.801,732.522
SPEAKER_01,It's her in her office with her computer by herself.,732.542,737.32
SPEAKER_01, And it's just her.,740.281,742.367
SPEAKER_01,I don't know how she pulled it off.,742.387,743.932
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, she hardly talks on the phone.",744.152,746.68
SPEAKER_01, And she's really happy.,748.841,749.744
SPEAKER_01,"And my parents, they actually met in college.",749.764,753.877
SPEAKER_01," When my dad, after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like,  you know, I could tell you were really nervous, but you did great.",755.64,765.959
SPEAKER_01,"And  they just, they seemed to bond over this nervousness that they both had.",765.98,772.08
SPEAKER_00, All right.,774.921,775.161
SPEAKER_00,"So there may be a history, a family history of symptoms like these.",775.181,780.58
SPEAKER_00, This is distressing for you.,784.88,786.205
SPEAKER_00,"You tried to avoid it and deal with it, but you haven't been,  you don't feel you've been very successful coping with it.",787.028,794.28
SPEAKER_00, We'll get you in for treatment.,796.881,799.291
SPEAKER_00,"We'll get you in the next couple of days to see a counselor,  if that's what you'd like to do.",799.311,803.319
SPEAKER_01," Yes, please.",803.523,803.853
SPEAKER_00, I think that could help.,804.261,805.345
SPEAKER_00,And I want to thank you for spending this time with me.,806.589,809.059
SPEAKER_00,It's really  helped me to understand better what you're facing.,809.079,812.04
SPEAKER_01, Thank you.,812.966,813.194
SPEAKER_00," Thanks, Sasha.",813.587,814.003
