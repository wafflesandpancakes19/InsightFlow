# InsightFlow

**LLM-Driven Synthesis of Patient Narratives for Mental Health into Causal Models**

InsightFlow is a research-oriented pipeline that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical case formulation through causal graphs. They are generated from mental health conversations. The system is designed to help researchers, clinicians, and data scientists convert unstructured dialogue into structured, interpretable representations of symptom dynamics and underlying causal relationships.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Extracting meaningful structure from mental health conversations is often time-consuming and subjective. InsightFlow automates this process by:

- Processing raw conversational transcripts
- Leveraging LLMs to interpret narrative context and semantics
- Constructing **causal graphs** that capture relationships between symptoms, behaviors, stressors, and outcomes
- Validating generated graphs against human-annotated ground truth

The project supports research in computational mental health, causal inference, explainable AI, and narrative understanding.
